<p>Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement includes our Privacy Policy and the addenda listed in <strong>Section 12</strong> below. Please review our Privacy Policy to learn about</p>

<p>Stream videos that you have the right to view;</p>
<p>Upload, store, and/or live stream videos, subject to your plan;</p>
<p>Embed our embeddable video player on third-party websites; and</p>
<p>Use all related functionality that we may provide.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The features available to you will depend on your plan. We may change features from time to time. If you have a paid account,</p>
<p>we commit to providing the core video hosting and streaming features of your plan (including the bandwidth and storage capabilities</p>

<p><strong>Unlimited Bandwidth Fair Use Policy:</strong> We provide self-serve users with unlimited bandwidth for standard uses of our embeddable</p>

<p>If your account (or group of jointly-controlled accounts) is within the 99th percentile of bandwidth usage for self-serve accounts for any</p>
<p>calendar month, then you must upgrade to an Enterprise plan. If you fail to do so, Vimeo may terminate your account upon ten (10) days’</p>
<p>written notice. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, you will be entitled to a pro-rata refund for the unused portion of the</p>
<p>subscription term, if any.</p>
<p>We may restrict bandwidth or charge extra for the following uses of our player or video hosting tools (which should generally occur via our</p>
<p>APIs (as defined below)): (1) plays on third-party sites without using our embeddable video player; (2) plays within third-party apps (e.g.,</p>
<p>mobile or connected TV apps); (3) plays when our player is connected to a third-party payment solution; or (4) plays when our player is</p>
<p>connected to a third-party advertising solution.</p>

<p>use the Apps. We may update Apps from time to time to add new features and/or correct bugs. You shall ensure that you are using the</p>
<p>most recent version of the App that is compatible with your device. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to use the most recent</p>
<p>version of the App on your device. Apps offered through third-party stores are subject to our Third-Party Service Addendum.</p>

<p></span>individualized agreement). Advertised prices and features may change.</p>

<p>they are film professionals or small film businesses; or (b) submit videos that they did not create or play a material part in creating.</p>

<p>monthly or annual fee plus variable fees for transactions or usage.</p>
<p><strong>Free trials and Discounts:</strong> We may offer free-trial or discounted subscriptions. When a free-trial period ends, your paid subscription</p>

<p>period, you must pay the discounted fee; in any renewal, you must pay the full fee.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, Self-Serve subscribers who purchase plans directly from Vimeo may cancel and receive a</p>
<p>full refund of their initial purchase within <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> after purchasing an annual plan and <strong>five (5) days</strong> after purchasing a monthly</p>
<p>plan. Our refund policy does not apply to:</p>
<p>In-app purchases;</p>
<p>Fees charged immediately after a free-trial period ends;</p>
<p>Subscription renewals or migrations to other plans;</p>
<p>Fees other than annual or monthly subscription fees;</p>

<p>current subscription period. Vimeo may decline renewals.</p>
<p><strong>Lapse Policy:</strong> When a subscription ends, the account will, at Vimeo’s option, revert to Basic (free) account status or will be deleted. Any</p>
<p>content in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your</p>
<p>content. Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of any content. We may publish additional guidelines regarding the treatment of</p>

<p>other legal claim; or (c) when Vimeo in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.</p>

<p></span>that you may have. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a license “condition<span style="background-color: green;">”</span><span style="background-color: red;">��?</span> applicable to Vimeo; rather, any<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>breach</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of a term </span>b<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">reach</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of a term by</p>

<p></span>licenses that you may grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).</p>

<p>actions or omissions by you that (regardless if proven) would constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p>

<p>whichever is longer. Paid accounts will continue for the subscription period and will renew in accordance with <strong>Section 4</strong> above. With</p>

<p>PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF VIMEO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p>
<p>SUCH DAMAGES; AND (B) VIMEO'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, EXCEPT FOR VIMEO’S CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS</p>
<p>HEREUNDER (IF ANY), SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO VIMEO OVER THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS</p>

<p><strong>11. Disputes, Arbitration, and Choice of Law</strong></p>
<p>If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact us first so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need</p>
<p>for outside assistance.</p>
<p><strong>11.1 Choice of Law</strong></p>
<p>Any disputes relating to this Agreement or your use of our Services will be governed by the laws of New York State and the United States</p>
<p>of America (with respect to matters subject to federal jurisdiction such as copyright), without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The</p>
<p>arbitration agreement set forth in <strong>Section 11.3</strong> will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p><strong>11.2 Choice of Venue for Litigation; Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p>
<p>Except for matters that must be arbitrated (as set forth below), you and Vimeo agree that any action relating to this Agreement or your use</p>
<p>of our Services must be commenced in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York State, United States of America;</p>
<p>you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. IN ANY SUCH ACTION, VIMEO AND YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT</p>
<p>TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p><strong>11.3 Arbitration of Privacy Claims; Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p>The exclusive means of resolving any Covered Privacy Claim (defined below) shall be BINDING ARBITRATION. The arbitration will be</p>
<p>administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, as modified by our Arbitration Procedures. If you</p>
<p>are a consumer, as defined by JAMS in its Consumer Minimum Standards, you may request that the arbitration hearing be conducted in</p>
<p>the area in which you reside. Otherwise, the hearing (if any) shall take place in New York County, New York State, United States of</p>
<p>America. EACH PARTY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, TO A TRIAL BY JURY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,</p>
<p>CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY COVERED PRIVACY CLAIM.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Arbitration provides a private dispute resolution process that is usually more streamlined and less formal than litigation. In an</p>
<p>arbitration, your rights will be determined by a neutral third party called an arbitrator, and not a judge or jury. Both you and Vimeo are</p>
<p>entitled to fundamentally fair proceedings at every stage of the arbitration, including the hearing. The arbitrator will decide all issues</p>
<p>relating to the dispute, including the question of arbitrability, and can grant any relief that a court could grant. Decisions by the arbitrator</p>
<p>are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our</p>
<p>Arbitration Procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong> A “<strong>Covered Privacy Claim</strong><span style="background-color: green;">”</span><span style="background-color: red;">��?</span> means any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to (a) Vimeo’s collection, use,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>storage,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>analysis, or transfer of your Personal Information; (b) an alleged breach of our Privacy Policy; (c) an alleged data breach or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>unauthorized<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>disclosure of data or content; or (d) an allegation that Vimeo failed to comply with any privacy or data security right or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>obligation.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>“<strong>Personal Information</strong><span style="background-color: green;">”</span><span style="background-color: red;">��?</span> means any information about you, including your registration information (e.g., email address),<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>payment</span> <span style="background-color: green;">payment</p>
<p></span>information, location information, device information, biometric identifiers or information, IP address, and your activities<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>(including viewing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and search history), but does not include content that you upload (except to the extent the content contains personal<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>information</span> <span style="background-color: red;">ab</span><span style="background-color: green;">inf</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u</span><span style="background-color: green;">rma</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ion</span> <span style="background-color: green;">about</p>
<p></span>you).</p>
<p><strong>Small Claims Court Exception:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, each party has the right to bring an individual Covered Privacy Claim</p>
<p>against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 1 of JAMS’ Minimum Consumer Standards. If one party</p>
<p>files an arbitration that could be litigated in such a small claims court, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small</p>
<p>claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall</p>
<p>be administratively closed. If requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall administratively close the arbitration so</p>
<p>long as the proceedings are at an early stage and no hearing has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>12. General Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reservation of Rights, Severability:</strong> Vimeo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein. Vimeo’s rights and remedies are</p>
<p>cumulative. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right. If any term of this Agreement is</p>
<p>found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be limited or severed.</p>
<p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Vimeo will not be liable for any delay or failure caused by (a) acts of God/natural disasters (including hurricanes and</p>
<p>earthquakes); (b) disease, epidemic, or pandemic; (c) terrorist attack, civil war, civil commotion or riots, armed conflict, sanctions or</p>
<p>embargoes; (d) nuclear, chemical, or biological contamination; (e) collapse of buildings, fire, explosion, or accident; (f) labor or trade</p>
<p>strikes; (g) interruption, loss, or malfunction of a utility, transportation, or telecommunications service; (h) any order by a government or</p>
<p>public authority, including a quarantine, travel restriction, or other prohibition; or (i) any other circumstance not within Vimeo’s reasonable</p>
<p>control, whether or not foreseeable (each a “<strong>force majeure event</strong><span style="background-color: green;">”</span><span style="background-color: red;">��?</span>). In the event of a force majeure event, Vimeo shall be relieved<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>from</span> <span style="background-color: green;">from</p>
<p></span>full performance of the contractual obligation until the event passes or no longer prevents performance.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship:</strong> You and Vimeo are independent contractors of one another; neither party is an agent, partner, or joint venturer of the other.</p>
<p>This Agreement binds the parties and their successors, personal representatives, and permitted assigns. You may not assign this</p>
<p>Agreement to any person whose account has been terminated by Vimeo or who is prohibited from registering; any such assignment will</p>
<p>be void. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement confers any right on any third party.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior understandings</p>
<p>regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except in accordance with <strong>Section 1</strong> or in a document executed by</p>
<p>authorized representatives of Vimeo. If you have a signed agreement with Vimeo, any conflicting term of that agreement will prevail over</p>
<p>the terms hereof, but only as to the subject matter of that agreement.</p>
<p>The English version of this Agreement shall control. For convenience, we may provide translated versions of this Agreement.</p>
