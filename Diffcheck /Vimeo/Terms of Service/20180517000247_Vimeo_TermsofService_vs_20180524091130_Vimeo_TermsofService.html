<p>General Provisions</p>
<p><strong>1. Who May Use the Vimeo Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>AGE REQUIREMENT:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use the Vimeo Service. If you are at least 13, but are still a minor (this</p>
<p>depends on where you live), you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use the Vimeo Service. Please have him or her</p>
<p>read this Agreement with you.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS:</strong> By granting your child permission to use the Vimeo Service, you agree to the terms of this</p>
<p>Agreement on behalf of your child. You are responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's use of the Vimeo Service. If your child</p>
<p>is using the Vimeo Service and is either under 13 or does not have your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can</p>
<p>disable his or her access. If you have questions about whether the Vimeo Service is appropriate for your child, please review our</p>
<p>Frequently Asked Questions or contact us.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Even if you are old enough to use the Vimeo Service and/or have your parent's or guardian's permission, some of the content</p>
<p>available within the Vimeo Service may not be appropriate for you. Some content may contain "R-rated" material, nudity, profanity, and</p>
<p>mature subject matter. If you are under 18, do not view such content.</p>
<p><strong>2. License to Use the Vimeo Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>LICENSE:</strong> Vimeo grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Vimeo Service for your own personal, non-</p>
<p>commercial purposes. This includes the right to view content available on the Vimeo Service. This license is personal to you and may not</p>
<p>be assigned or sublicensed to anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>COMMERCIAL USE:</strong> You may not use the Vimeo Service for commercial purposes unless:</p>
<p>You are a Vimeo PRO or higher subscriber, in which case you may use and access the Vimeo Service for commercial and non-</p>
<p>commercial purposes, subject to compliance with the Vimeo Guidelines; or</p>
<p>You are a small-scale independent production company, non-profit, or artist, in which case you may use the Vimeo Service to</p>
<p>showcase or promote your own creative works.</p>
<p>If you sell Vimeo-hosted videos directly to users other than through Vimeo On Demand, such usage will be deemed an "Application"</p>
<p>under our API Terms (whether you use our API or not) and will be subject to our API Terms.</p>
<p><strong>RESTRICTIONS:</strong> Except as expressly permitted by Vimeo in writing, you will not scrape, reproduce, redistribute, sell, create derivative</p>
<p>works from, decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble the Vimeo Service or any source code therein. Nor will you attempt to</p>
<p>circumvent any of Vimeo's technical measures or take any measures to interfere with or damage the Vimeo Service. All rights not</p>
<p>expressly granted by Vimeo are reserved.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE APP:</strong> Your use of the Vimeo Service through one of our mobile applications is also subject to our Mobile App Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>3. Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy rights are set forth in our Privacy Policy, which forms a part of this Agreement. Please review the Privacy Policy to learn</p>
<p>about:</p>
<p>What information we may collect about you;</p>
<p>What we use that information for; and</p>
<p>With whom we share that information.</p>
<p><strong>4. Membership</strong></p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION:</strong> To fully use the Vimeo Service, you must register as a member by providing a user name, password, and valid email</p>
<p>address. You must provide complete and accurate registration information to Vimeo and notify us if your information changes. If you are a</p>
<p>business, government, or non-profit entity, the person whose email address is associated with the account must have the authority to bind</p>
<p>the entity to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>USER NAME:</strong> We encourage you to use your real name. If you are a business, government, or non-profit entity, you must use the actual<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>We use cookies to give you the best experience possible. By using our site, you agree to our use of cookies. See more in our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Okay</strong></span></p>
<p>name of your organization. You may not use someone else's name, a name that violates any third party right, or a name that is obscene or</p>
<p>otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT SECURITY:</strong> You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by authorized or</p>
<p>unauthorized users. You must not allow others to use your account credentials and you must safeguard the confidentiality of those</p>
<p>credentials. If you are using a computer that others have access to, you must log out of your account after using the Vimeo Service. If you</p>
<p>become aware of an unauthorized access to your account, you must change your password and notify us immediately.</p>
<p><strong>SEAT ACCESS:</strong> If you are a PRO or Business subscriber, you may grant access to your account to other Vimeo members subject to a</p>
<p>seat limit. You are responsible for the actions of those persons insofar as your account is concerned. If you are a Vimeo member who has</p>
<p>been granted access to a PRO or Business account, you must comply with the terms of this Agreement in accessing that account.</p>
<p><strong>5. Subscriptions and Purchases</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUBSCRIPTIONS:</strong> In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer paid subscriptions. Please see our subscription</p>
<p>pages for current features and pricing. Features and prices are subject to change. Storage limits are calculated based upon source files.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to charge for excessive use of bandwidth where plays occur on third-party sites and applications outside the native</p>
<p>Vimeo player or apps. Anyone who wishes to obtain storage capacity beyond what is offered with a particular subscription, or additional</p>
<p>bandwidth for applications not using the Vimeo player may request a custom account by contacting us here: join.vimeo.com/custom.</p>
<p>Additional terms and conditions (to be shown prior to purchase) apply to custom accounts. All fees may be subject to taxes.</p>
<p><strong>CANCELATION AND REFUNDS:</strong> Users who purchase annual subscriptions have thirty (30) days after their purchase to cancel and</p>
<p>receive a full refund. Users who purchase monthly subscriptions have five (5) days after purchase to cancel and receive a full refund. In the</p>
<p>case of Live subscription products, refunds are not available if the user has exceeded the storage or bandwidth threshold set forth in the</p>
<p>refund policy presented at the time of purchase. After the cancelation period ends, all purchases are final and all fees paid are non-</p>
<p>refundable, even if your account is later terminated by Vimeo. If your account is terminated due to your breach of this Agreement during</p>
<p>the relevant cancelation period, you will not be refunded. If you have questions, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>RENEWALS:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, you may choose to renew your subscription at the end of the subscription period. By default, all</p>
<p>subscriptions are set to automatically renew for the same period of time as the original subscription. You may decline to renew at any time</p>
<p>prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription. Vimeo reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for</p>
<p>any reason. Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription periods.</p>
<p><strong>END OF SUBSCRIPTION:</strong> When a paid subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a Basic (free) account and Vimeo may</p>
<p>disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits. If you're using Vimeo for commercial purposes, you will need</p>
<p>to maintain a Vimeo PRO or higher plan to continue hosting your videos. Your account and its content may be deleted if your subscription</p>
<p>is not renewed.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER PURCHASES:</strong> Purchases of other products and services through the Vimeo Service are subject to our Payment Addendum</p>
<p>and to other terms and conditions that are presented to you at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>6. Term and Termination; Account Deletion</strong></p>
<p><strong>TERM:</strong> This Agreement begins on the date you first use the Vimeo Service and continues as long as you have an account with us.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> You may delete your account at any time. Basic accounts may be deleted from the Vimeo Service if they remain</p>
<p>inactive (i.e., the user fails to log in) for a continuous period of at least six (6) months. Paid subscription accounts will remain active until</p>
<p>the end of the subscription term and any renewal term.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION FOR BREACH:</strong> Vimeo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any</p>
<p>content you submitted if Vimeo determines that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would</p>
<p>tend to damage Vimeo's reputation and goodwill. If Vimeo deletes your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the</p>
<p>Vimeo Service. Vimeo may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
<p><strong>EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> Upon termination, all licenses granted by Vimeo will terminate. Sections 6 and 11</p>
<p>though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion for any reason, content that you submitted may no longer be available.</p>
<p>Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of such content.</p>
<p><strong>7. Content Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload, post, or transmit (collectively, "submit") any video, image, text, audio recording, or other work (collectively, "content")</p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>Infringes any third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.);</p>
<p>Contains sexually explicit content or pornography (provided, however, that non-sexual nudity is permitted);</p>
<p>Contains hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incites hatred against any individual or group;</p>
<p>Exploits minors;</p>
<p>Depicts unlawful acts or extreme violence;</p>
<p>Depicts animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals;</p>
<p>Promotes fraudulent or dubious business schemes; or</p>
<p>Violates any law.</p>
<p>All videos you submit must also comply with the Vimeo Guidelines, which are incorporated into this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8. Code of Conduct</strong></p>
<p>In using the Vimeo Service, you must behave in a civil and respectful manner at all times. Further, you will not:</p>
<p>Act in a deceptive manner by, among other things, impersonating any person;</p>
<p>Harass or stalk any other person;</p>
<p>Harm or exploit minors;</p>
<p>Distribute "spam";</p>
<p>Collect information about others; or</p>
<p>Advertise or solicit others to purchase any product or service within the Vimeo Site (unless you are an official Vimeo partner or</p>
<p>advertiser and have a written agreement with Vimeo).</p>
<p>Vimeo has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor all conduct on and content submitted to the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p><strong>9. Licenses Granted by You</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Videos</strong></p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO VIMEO:</strong> As between you and Vimeo, you own the video content ("videos") that you submit to the Vimeo Service. By</p>
<p>submitting a video, you grant Vimeo and its affiliates a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit,</p>
<p>distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your video for</p>
<p>the purpose of (i) displaying the video within the Vimeo Service; (ii) displaying the video on third party websites and applications through</p>
<p>a video embed or Vimeo's API subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) allowing other users to play, download, and embed on third party</p>

<p>publicly available; and (v) archiving or preserving the video for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.</p>
<p><strong>LIVE STREAMS:</strong> For the purposes hereof, a "video" includes a live stream and you are deemed to have "submitted" a video when you</p>
<p>live stream any content using the Vimeo Service, regardless of whether a permanent copy is created.</p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO OTHER USERS:</strong> You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your videos for their personal, non-</p>
<p>commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the videos solely to the extent necessary to view the</p>
<p>videos. The foregoing licenses are in addition to any license you may decide to grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).</p>
<p><strong>DURATION OF LICENSES:</strong> The above licenses will continue unless and until you remove your videos from the Vimeo Service, in which</p>
<p>case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal</p>
<p>archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely. Please note that removed videos may be cached in search engine indices after</p>
<p>removal and that Vimeo has no control over such caching.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Non-video Content</strong></p>
<p>As between you and Vimeo, you own all non-video content that you submit to the Vimeo Service. You grant Vimeo and its affiliates a</p>
<p>worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display</p>
<p>(through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your non-video content. In addition, you waive any</p>
<p>so-called "moral rights" in your non-video content. You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your non-video</p>
<p>content for their personal, non-commercial purposes. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on improving or adding new features to the</p>
<p>Vimeo Service, Vimeo shall have the right to use your suggestions without any compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong>10. Your Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
<p>For each piece of content that you submit, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right to submit the content to Vimeo and grant</p>
<p>the licenses set forth above; (ii) Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party; (iii) the</p>
<p>content does not infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and (iv) the content complies with</p>
<p>this Agreement and all applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all</p>
<p>third party actions that: (i) arise from your activities on the Vimeo Service; (ii) assert a violation by you of any term of this Agreement; or</p>
<p>(iii) assert that any content you submitted to Vimeo violates any law or infringes any third party right, including any intellectual property or</p>
<p>privacy right.</p>
<p><strong>12. Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please send us a notice as</p>
<p>set forth in our Copyright and DMCA Policy, which is incorporated into this Agreement. For other intellectual property claims, please send</p>
<p>us a notice at legal[at]vimeo[dot]com.</p>
<p><strong>13. Disclaimers</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo reserves the right to modify the Vimeo Service. You are responsible for providing your own access (e.g., computer, mobile device,</p>
<p>Internet connection, etc.) to the Vimeo Service. Vimeo has no obligation to screen or monitor any content and does not guarantee that any</p>
<p>content available on the Vimeo Service complies with this Agreement or is suitable for all users.</p>
<p>Vimeo provides the Vimeo Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis. You therefore use the Vimeo Service at your own risk. Vimeo</p>
<p>expressly disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of</p>
<p>merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any other warranty that might arise under any law. Without limiting</p>
<p>the foregoing, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be permitted in your jurisdiction;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;</p>
<p>Concerning any content submitted by any member;</p>
<p>Concerning any third party's use of content that you submit;</p>
<p>That any content you submit will be made available on the Vimeo Service or will be stored by Vimeo;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will meet your business or professional needs;</p>
<p>That Vimeo will continue to support any particular feature of the Vimeo Service; or</p>
<p>Concerning sites and resources outside of the Vimeo Service, even if linked to from the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p>To the extent any disclaimer or limitation of liability does not apply, all applicable express, implied, and statutory warranties will be limited</p>
<p>in duration to a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which you first used the Vimeo Service, and no warranties shall apply after such</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p><strong>14. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) Vimeo shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or</strong></p>
<p><strong>exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses;</strong></p>
<p><strong>and (ii) Vimeo's total liability to you shall not exceed the amounts paid by you to Vimeo over the twelve (12) months</strong></p>
<p><strong>preceding your claim(s).</strong></p>
<p><strong>15. Compliance Notice Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257</strong></p>
<p>All pictures, graphics, videos, and other visual media displayed on the Vimeo Service are exempt from 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 and 28 C.F.R.</p>
<p>75 because they do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. ยง 2256 (2) (A) - (D), but are merely, at most,</p>
<p>depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual</p>
<p>depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995. Vimeo is not the primary producer of the visual content contained in the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p><strong>16. General Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW:</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to</p>
<p>principles of conflicts of law. The Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, and the United Nations</p>
<p>Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p>
<p><strong>DISPUTES:</strong> Any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Vimeo Service must be commenced in the state or</p>
<p>federal courts located in New York County, New York, United States of America (and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts). In any</p>
<p>such action, Vimeo and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.</p>
<p><strong>INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; REMEDIES:</strong> Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the</p>
<p>terms of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that term</p>
<p>will be severed from this Agreement. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right hereunder will waive any further exercise of that</p>
<p>right. Vimeo's rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES:</strong> This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit</p>
<p>of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns. You</p>
<p>may not assign this Agreement without Vimeo's prior written consent. No third party shall have any rights hereunder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICES:</strong> You consent to receive all communications including notices, agreements, disclosures, or other information from Vimeo</p>
<p>electronically. Vimeo may provide all such communications by email or by posting them on the Vimeo Service. For support-related</p>
<p>inquiries, you may contact us. You may send notices of a legal nature to Vimeo at legal[at]vimeo[dot]com or the following address:</p>
<p><em>Vimeo, Inc. 555 West 18th Street New York, New York 10011 Attention: Legal Department</em></p>
<p>Nothing herein shall limit Vimeo's right to object to subpoenas, claims, or other demands.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFICATION:</strong> This Agreement may not be modified except by a revised Terms of Service posted by Vimeo on the Vimeo Site or a</p>
<p>written amendment signed by an authorized representative of Vimeo. A revised Terms of Service will be effective as of the date it is</p>
<p>posted on the Vimeo Site.</p>
