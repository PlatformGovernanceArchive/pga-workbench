<p><strong>NOTICE TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS:</strong> By granting your child permission to use the Vimeo Service, you agree</p>
<p>to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your child. You are responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's</p>
<p>use of the Vimeo Service. If your child is using the Vimeo Service and is either under 13 or does not have your</p>
<p>permission, please contact us immediately so that we can disable his or her access. If you have questions about</p>
<p>whether the Vimeo Service is appropriate for your child, please review our <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong> or <strong>contact</strong></p>
<p><strong>us</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Even if you are old enough to use the Vimeo Service and/or have your parent's or guardian's permission,</p>
<p>some of the content available within the Vimeo Service may not be appropriate for you. Some content may contain "R-</p>
<p>rated" material, nudity, profanity, and mature subject matter. If you are under 18, do not view such content.</p>
<p><strong>2. License to Use the Vimeo Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>LICENSE:</strong> Vimeo grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Vimeo Service for your own</p>
<p>personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to view content available on the Vimeo Service. This</p>
<p>license is personal to you and may not be assigned or sublicensed to anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>COMMERCIAL USE:</strong> You may not use the Vimeo Service for commercial purposes unless:</p>
<p>You are a Vimeo PRO user, in which case you may use and access the Vimeo Service for commercial and non-</p>
<p>commercial purposes, subject to compliance with the <strong>Vimeo Guidelines</strong>; or</p>
<p>You are a small-scale independent production company, non-profit, or artist, in which case you may use the Vimeo</p>
<p>Service to showcase or promote your own creative works.</p>
<p><strong>RESTRICTIONS:</strong> Except as expressly permitted by Vimeo in writing, you will not reproduce, redistribute, sell, create</p>
<p>derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble the Vimeo Service. Nor will you take any</p>
<p>measures to interfere with or damage the Vimeo Service. All rights not expressly granted by Vimeo are reserved.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE APP:</strong> Your use of the Vimeo Service through one of our mobile applications is also subject to our <strong>Mobile</strong></p>
<p><strong>App Addendum</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy rights are set forth in our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, which forms a part of this Agreement. Please review the Privacy</p>
<p>Policy to learn about:</p>
<p>What information we may collect about you;</p>
<p>What we use that information for; and</p>
<p>With whom we share that information.</p>
<p><strong>4. Membership</strong></p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION:</strong> To fully use the Vimeo Service, you must register as a member by providing a user name,</p>
<p>password, and valid email address. You must provide complete and accurate registration information to Vimeo and</p>
<p>notify us if your information changes. If you are a business, government, or non-profit entity, the person whose email</p>
<p>address is associated with the account must have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>USER NAME:</strong> We encourage you to use your real name. If you are a business, government, or non-profit entity, you</p>
<p>must use the actual name of your organization. You may not use someone else's name, a name that violates any third</p>
<p>party right, or a name that is obscene or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT SECURITY:</strong> You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by</p>
<p>unauthorized users. You must not allow others to use your account. You must safeguard the confidentiality of your</p>
<p>password. If you are using a computer that others have access to, you must log out of your account after using the</p>
<p>Vimeo Service. If you become aware of an unauthorized access to your account, you must change your password and</p>
<p><strong>notify us immediately</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Subscriptions and Purchases</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIMEO PLUS AND PRO:</strong> In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer Vimeo Plus and Vimeo</p>
<p>PRO subscriptions. Please see our subscription pages for current <strong>Plus</strong> and <strong>PRO</strong> features and pricing. Features and</p>
<p>prices are subject to change. Storage limits are calculated based upon source files. We may also offer add-on features</p>
<p>and packages. Vimeo PRO users who wish to obtain additional storage may request a custom account by contacting</p>
<p>us here: <strong>vimeo.com/help/contact</strong>. Additional terms and conditions (to be shown prior to purchase) apply to custom</p>
<p>accounts. All fees may be subject to taxes.</p>
<p><strong>CANCELATION AND REFUNDS:</strong> Users who purchase annual subscriptions have thirty (30) days after their purchase</p>
<p>to cancel and receive a full refund. Users who purchase monthly subscriptions have five (5) days after purchase to</p>
<p>cancel and receive a full refund. After the cancelation period ends, all purchases are final and all fees paid are non-</p>
<p>refundable, even if your account is later terminated by Vimeo. If your account is terminated due to your breach of this</p>
<p>Agreement during the relevant cancelation period, you will not be refunded. If you have questions, please <strong>contact us</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>RENEWALS:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, you may choose to renew your subscription at the end of the subscription</p>
<p>period. By default, all subscriptions are set to automatically renew for the same period of time as the original</p>
<p>subscription. You may decline to renew at any time prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription. Vimeo</p>
<p>reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for any reason. PRO subscriptions offered</p>
<p>beginning on October 15, 2013 may not be available to existing users whose storage as of that date exceeds the</p>
<p>yearly maximum for a PRO account. Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription</p>
<p>periods.</p>
<p><strong>END OF SUBSCRIPTION:</strong> When a Vimeo Plus or PRO subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a</p>
<p>Basic (free) account and Vimeo may disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits. When</p>
<p>a custom or PRO Unlimited subscription ends, the account and its content will be deleted if the subscription is not</p>
<p>renewed.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER PURCHASES:</strong> Purchases of other products and services through the Vimeo Service are subject to our</p>
<p><strong>Payment Addendum</strong> and to other terms and conditions that are presented to you at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>6. Term and Termination; Account Deletion</strong></p>
<p><strong>TERM:</strong> This Agreement begins on the date you first use the Vimeo Service and continues as long as you have an</p>
<p>account with us.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> You may delete your account at any time. Basic accounts may be deleted from the Vimeo</p>
<p>Service if they remain inactive (i.e., the user fails to log in) for a continuous period of at least six (6) months.</p>
<p>Subscription accounts will remain active until the end of the subscription term and any renewal term.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION FOR BREACH:</strong> Vimeo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or</p>
<p>remove any content you submitted if Vimeo determines that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that</p>
<p>your conduct or content would tend to damage Vimeo's reputation and goodwill. If Vimeo deletes your account for the</p>
<p>foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the Vimeo Service. Vimeo may block your email address and Internet</p>
<p>protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
<p><strong>EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> Upon termination, all licenses granted by Vimeo will terminate.</p>
<p>Sections 6 and 11 though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion for any reason, content that you</p>
<p>submitted may no longer be available. Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of such content.</p>
<p><strong>7. Content Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload, post, or transmit (collectively, "submit") any video, image, text, audio recording, or other work</p>
<p>(collectively, "content") that:</p>
<p>Infringes any third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.);</p>
<p>Contains sexually explicit content or pornography (provided, however, that non-sexual nudity is permitted);</p>
<p>Contains hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incites hatred against any individual or group;</p>

<p>Depicts unlawful acts or extreme violence;</p>
<p>Depicts animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals;</p>
<p>Promotes fraudulent or dubious business schemes; or</p>
<p>Violates any law.</p>
<p>All videos you submit must also comply with the <strong>Vimeo Guidelines</strong>, which are incorporated into this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8. Code of Conduct</strong></p>
<p>In using the Vimeo Service, you must behave in a civil and respectful manner at all times. Further, you will not:</p>
<p>Act in a deceptive manner by, among other things, impersonating any person;</p>
<p>Harass or stalk any other person;</p>
<p>Harm or exploit minors;</p>
<p>Distribute "spam";</p>
<p>Collect information about others; or</p>
<p>Advertise or solicit others to purchase any product or service within the Vimeo Site (unless you are an official</p>
<p>Vimeo partner or advertiser and have a written agreement with Vimeo).</p>
<p>Vimeo has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor all conduct on and content submitted to the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p><strong>9. Licenses Granted by You</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Videos</strong></p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO VIMEO:</strong> As between you and Vimeo, you own the video content ("videos") that you submit to the Vimeo</p>

<p>Service; (ii) displaying the video on third party websites and applications through a video embed or Vimeo's API</p>
<p>subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) allowing other users to play, download, and embed on third party websites</p>
<p>the video, subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) promoting the Vimeo Service, provided that you have made the</p>
<p>video publicly available; and (iv) archiving or preserving the video for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.</p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO OTHER USERS:</strong> You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your videos for</p>
<p>their personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the videos</p>
<p>solely to the extent necessary to view the videos. The foregoing licenses are in addition to any license you may decide</p>
<p>to grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).</p>
<p><strong>DURATION OF LICENSES:</strong> The above licenses will continue unless and until you remove your videos from the Vimeo</p>
<p>Service, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable period of time. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely. Please note that removed</p>
<p>videos may be cached in search engine indices after removal and that Vimeo has no control over such caching.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Non-video Content</strong></p>
<p>As between you and Vimeo, you own all non-video content that you submit to the Vimeo Service. You grant Vimeo and</p>
<p>its affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit,</p>
<p>distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works</p>
<p>from your non-video content. In addition, you waive any so-called "moral rights" in your non-video content. You further</p>
<p>grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your non-video content for their personal, non-commercial</p>
<p>purposes. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on improving or adding new features to the Vimeo Service, Vimeo shall</p>
<p>have the right to use your suggestions without any compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong>10. Your Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
<p>For each piece of content that you submit, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right to submit the content to</p>
<p>Vimeo and grant the licenses set forth above; (ii) Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay</p>
<p>royalties to any third party; (iii) the content does not infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights</p>
<p>and privacy rights; and (iv) the content complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from</p>
<p>and against all third party actions that: (i) arise from your activities on the Vimeo Service; (ii) assert a violation by you of</p>
<p>any term of this Agreement; or (iii) assert that any content you submitted to Vimeo violates any law or infringes any third</p>
<p>party right, including any intellectual property or privacy right.</p>
<p><strong>12. Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please</p>
<p>send us a notice as set forth in our <strong>Copyright and DMCA Policy</strong>, which is incorporated into this Agreement. For other</p>
<p>intellectual property claims, please send us a notice at legal[at]vimeo[dot]com.</p>

<p>Vimeo reserves the right to modify the Vimeo Service. You are responsible for providing your own access (e.g.,</p>
<p>computer, mobile device, Internet connection, etc.) to the Vimeo Service. Vimeo has no obligation to screen or monitor</p>
<p>any content and does not guarantee that any content available on the Vimeo Service complies with this Agreement or</p>
<p>is suitable for all users.</p>
<p>Vimeo provides the Vimeo Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis. You therefore use the Vimeo Service at your</p>
<p>own risk. Vimeo expressly disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not</p>
<p>limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any other</p>
<p>warranty that might arise under any law. Without limiting the foregoing, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be permitted in your jurisdiction;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;</p>
<p>Concerning any content submitted by any member;</p>
<p>Concerning any third party's use of content that you submit;</p>
<p>That any content you submit will be made available on the Vimeo Service or will be stored by Vimeo;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will meet your business or professional needs;</p>
<p>That Vimeo will continue to support any particular feature of the Vimeo Service; or</p>
<p>Concerning sites and resources outside of the Vimeo Service, even if linked to from the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p>To the extent any disclaimer or limitation of liability does not apply, all applicable express, implied, and statutory</p>
<p>warranties will be limited in duration to a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which you first used the Vimeo</p>
<p>Service, and no warranties shall apply after such period.</p>
<p><strong>14. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) Vimeo shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,</strong></p>
<p><strong>consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill,</strong></p>
<p><strong>use, data or other intangible losses; and (ii) Vimeo's total liability to you shall not exceed the amounts paid</strong></p>
<p><strong>by you to Vimeo over the twelve (12) months preceding your claim(s).</strong></p>

<p>All pictures, graphics, videos, and other visual media displayed on the Vimeo Service are exempt from 18 U.S.C. §</p>
<p>2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 because they do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2256</p>
<p>(2) (A) - (D), but are merely, at most, depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual</p>
<p>conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995. Vimeo is not the</p>
<p>primary producer of the visual content contained in the Vimeo Service.</p>

<p><strong>DISPUTES:</strong> Any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Vimeo Service must be</p>
<p>commenced in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, United States of America (and you</p>

<p>jury.</p>
<p><strong>INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; REMEDIES:</strong> Headings are for convenience only and shall not be</p>
<p>used to construe the terms of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by any</p>
<p>court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be severed from this Agreement. No failure or delay by Vimeo in</p>
<p>exercising any right hereunder will waive any further exercise of that right. Vimeo's rights and remedies hereunder are</p>
<p>cumulative and not exclusive.</p>

<p>inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal</p>
<p>representatives, and permitted assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without Vimeo's prior written consent. No</p>
<p>third party shall have any rights hereunder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICES:</strong> You consent to receive all communications including notices, agreements, disclosures, or other information</p>
<p>from Vimeo electronically. Vimeo may provide all such communications by email or by posting them on the Vimeo</p>
