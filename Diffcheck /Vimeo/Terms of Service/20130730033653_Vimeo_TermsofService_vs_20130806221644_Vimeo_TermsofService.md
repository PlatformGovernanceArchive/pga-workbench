**ACCOUNT DELETION:** You may delete your account at any time. Basic accounts may be deleted from the Vimeo Service if they remain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>inactive (i.e., the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">
