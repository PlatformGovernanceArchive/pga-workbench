<p><strong>1. Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>By creating an account, viewing videos, making a purchase, downloading our software, or otherwise visiting or using our Services, you</p>
<p>accept this Agreement and consent to contract with us electronically.</p>
<p>If you are an entity other than a natural person, the person who registers the account or otherwise uses our Services must have the</p>
<p>authority to bind the entity. In this context, “you” means both the entity and each person who is authorized to access the account.</p>
<p>We may update this Agreement by posting a revised version on our website. By continuing to use our Services, you accept any revised</p>
<p>Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement includes our Privacy Policy and the addenda listed in <strong>Section 11</strong> below. Please review our Privacy Policy to learn about</p>
<p>the information we collect from you, how we use it, and with whom we share it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Our Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service License:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, we grant you access to our Services. This includes the right to:</p>
<p>Stream videos that you have the right to view;</p>
<p>Upload, store, and/or live stream videos, subject to your plan;</p>
<p>Embed our embeddable video player on third-party websites; and</p>
<p>Use all related functionality that we may provide.</p>
<p>The features available to you will depend on your plan. We may change features from time to time. If you have a paid account, we commit</p>
<p>to providing the core video hosting and streaming features of your plan (including the bandwidth and storage capabilities stated at the</p>
<p>time of purchase) during your current service period. We may charge for excessive bandwidth use when: (1) plays occur on third-party</p>
<p>sites without using our embeddable video player; (2) plays occur within third-party apps (e.g., mobile or connected TV apps); (3) you</p>
<p>monetize Vimeo-hosted videos using a third-party payment solution; or (4) you use our video player with a third-party advertising solution.</p>
<p><strong>Video Creation Tools:</strong> We may allow you to use Video Create, our video creation tools. Your use of Vimeo Create is governed by our</p>
<p>Vimeo Create Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>Transactions:</strong> We may offer digital goods for sale. Purchases of Vimeo On Demand videos are governed by our Vimeo On Demand</p>
<p>Viewer Agreement. Purchases of Vimeo Stock footage and licenses are governed by our Vimeo Stock License Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization:</strong> We may allow you to sell digital goods or earn money through advertising. Your sales of videos are governed by our Seller</p>
<p>Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software:</strong> We may offer applications for devices (“<strong>Apps</strong>”) directly or through third-party stores. Apps are governed by</p>
<p>our App Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Tools:</strong> We may offer application programming interfaces (“<strong>APIs</strong>”) that allow developers to build applications connected to</p>
<p>our Services. Our APIs and related documentation are governed by our API License Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Services:</strong> We may offer Services pursuant to an individually-negotiated agreement. Enterprise services are governed by our</p>
<p>Enterprise Terms.</p>
<p><strong>3. Accounts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong> You may create an account to use certain features we offer (e.g., uploading or live streaming videos). To do so, you must</p>
<p>provide an email address. You consent to receive notices from Vimeo at this email address.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Accounts:</strong> Corporate, governmental, and other organizational users must publicly display the legal name of their entity</p>
<p>on their public account profile. If you are a government entity in the U.S., our Government Entity Addendum applies.</p>
<p><strong>Age Requirements:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. If you reside in the European Union, you must be at least 16</p>
<p>years old. If you wish to use the Services for a commercial purpose, you must be at least 18 years old. If you are at least the requisite age,</p>
<p>but are still a minor in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission. Please have that person read this</p>
<p>Agreement with you and consent to it before proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Parents and Guardians:</strong> By granting your child permission, you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your child. You are</p>
<p>responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's usage. If your child is either under the applicable age or does not have your</p>
<p>permission, please contact us immediately so that we can disable access.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Certain subscription plans may allow you to grant other registered users (“<strong>team members</strong>”) access to the account.</p>
<p>Both you and each team member is deemed a party to this Agreement. You are responsible for the actions of your team members and</p>
<p>must monitor their access and usage.</p>
<p><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including unauthorized activity. You must safeguard</p>
<p>the confidentiality of your account credentials. If you are using a computer that others have access to, you must log out of your account</p>
<p>after each session. If you become aware of unauthorized access to your account, you must change your password and notify us</p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p><strong>4. Subscription Plans</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plan Types:</strong> We offer free (Basic) memberships and paid subscriptions that allow you to upload and share video content. You may</p>
<p>purchase a “<strong>Self-Serve</strong>” plan (you sign up and pay online) or an “<strong>Enterprise</strong>” plan (you work with a sales representative and execute an</p>
<p>individualized agreement). Advertised prices and features may change.</p>
<p><strong>Basic and Plus Accounts:</strong> Vimeo Basic (free) members and Plus subscribers may not: (a) use the Services for commercial purposes</p>
<p>unless they are film professionals or small film businesses; or (b) submit videos that they did not create or play a material part in creating.</p>
<p><strong>Fees:</strong> You must pay all fees (plus any taxes) during your subscription period and any renewal periods. Our fees may include a fixed</p>
<p>monthly or annual fee plus variable fees for transactions or usage.</p>
<p><strong>Free trials and Discounts:</strong> We may offer free-trial or discounted subscriptions. When a free-trial period ends, your paid subscription</p>
<p>begins (unless you have cancelled) and you must pay the full monthly or annual fee. If we provide a discount for the first subscription</p>
<p>period, you must pay the discounted fee; in any renewal, you must pay the full fee.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Subject to the terms hereof, Self-Serve subscribers who purchase plans directly from Vimeo may cancel and receive a</p>
<p>full refund of their initial purchase with <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> after purchasing an annual plan and <strong>five (5) days</strong> after purchasing a monthly plan.</p>
<p>Our refund policy does not apply to:</p>
<p>In-app purchases;</p>
<p>Subscription renewals or migrations to other plans;</p>
<p>Fees other than annual or monthly subscription fees;</p>
<p>Requests made after the specified periods;</p>
<p>Customers who have breached this Agreement or whose accounts were terminated in accordance with our Copyright Policy;</p>
<p>Customers who joined using a promotion that expressly disclaimed our refund policy;</p>
<p>Customers who have initiated a chargeback dispute; or</p>
<p>Enterprise plan customers.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> <strong>To the extent permitted by applicable law, subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each</strong></p>
<p><strong>subscription period unless cancelled beforehand. Monthly plans renew for 30-day periods. Annual plans renew for one-year</strong></p>
<p><strong>periods.</strong> You must pay the annual or monthly fee (plus any taxes) when each renewal period starts. Unused storage, bandwidth, and other</p>
<p>usage limits do not roll over.</p>
<p><strong>How to Decline Renewal:</strong> <strong>Self-Serve customers may opt out of automatic renewal by changing their account settings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enterprise customers may opt out according to the</strong> Enterprise Terms<strong>.</strong> Any opt-out or notice of non-renewal will not affect the current</p>
<p>subscription period. Vimeo may decline renewals.</p>
<p><strong>Lapse Policy:</strong> When a subscription ends, the account will, at Vimeo’s option, revert to free account status or will be deleted. Any content</p>
<p>in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your content.</p>
<p>Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of any content. We may publish additional guidelines regarding the treatment of lapsed</p>
<p>subscriptions. These guidelines describe current practices only and shall not require Vimeo to provide any level of post-subscription</p>
<p>account status.</p>
<p><strong>In-App Purchase:</strong> We may allow you to purchase subscriptions within Apps. When you make such “in-app” purchases, you will be billed</p>
<p>by the app platform, not us. <strong>To turn off automatic renewal for subscriptions, access your platform’s account settings (not</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vimeo’s).</strong> Our refund policy does not apply to in-app purchases. Any billing inquiries should be directed to the app platform.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acceptable Use Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may allow you to upload, live stream, submit, or publish (collectively, to "<strong>submit</strong>") content such as videos, recordings, images, and</p>
<p>text (collectively, "<strong>content</strong>"). You must ensure that your content, and your conduct, complies with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in this</p>
<p><strong>Section 5</strong>. Vimeo may (but is not obligated to) monitor your account, content, and conduct, regardless of your privacy settings. Vimeo</p>
<p>may take all appropriate actions to enforce its rights including removing specific videos or suspending or removing your account.</p>
<p><strong>5.1 Copyright Policy</strong></p>
<p>You may only upload content that you have the right to upload and share. Copyright owners may send Vimeo a takedown notice as stated</p>
<p>in our Copyright Policy if they believe Vimeo is hosting infringing materials. We will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts</p>
<p>of persons who repeatedly infringe.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Content Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You may not submit any content that:</p>
<p>Infringes any third party’s copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.);</p>

<p>rated by others. You must rate your videos appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>6. Licenses Granted by You</strong></p>
<p>As between you and Vimeo, you own and will retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the content you submit. In order to</p>
<p>allow Vimeo to host and stream your content, you grant Vimeo the permissions set forth below.</p>
<p><strong>6.1 Your Video Content</strong></p>
<p>By submitting a video, you grant Vimeo permission to:</p>
<p>Stream the video to end users;</p>
<p>Embed the video on third-party websites;</p>
<p>Distribute the video via our APIs;</p>
<p>Make the video available for download;</p>
<p>Transcode the video (create compressed versions of your video file that are optimized for streaming); and</p>
<p>Generate stills (i.e., “thumbnails”) from your video to represent it (if you have not selected one).</p>
<p>If you have enabled a video privacy setting or disabled downloading or embedding, we will limit distribution of your video pursuant to your</p>
<p>selection. By enabling access to your video to any third party, you grant each such person permission to stream (and/or download or</p>
<p>embed, as applicable) your video. For the purposes of this <strong>Section 6.1</strong>, your video includes its title, description, tags, and other</p>
<p>metadata.</p>
<p>The license period begins when you submit the video to Vimeo and ends when you or Vimeo delete it; <em>provided</em> that Vimeo may retain</p>
<p>archival copies: (a) for a limited period of time in case you wish to restore it; (b) when the video is the subject of a takedown notice or</p>
<p>other legal claim; or (c) when Vimeo in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 Vimeo Create Content</strong></p>
<p>You may submit certain content to us for the purpose of creating a video using Vimeo Create. These submissions, and the resulting</p>
<p>videos, are governed by our Vimeo Create Addendum.</p>
<p><strong>6.3 Account Profile</strong></p>
<p>You grant Vimeo permission to use your name, likeness, biography, trademarks, logos, or other identifiers used by you in your account</p>
<p>profile for the purpose of displaying such properties to the public or the audiences you have specified. You may revoke the foregoing</p>
<p>permission by deleting your account.</p>
<p><strong>6.4 Other Content; Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Content that is not covered by the licenses set forth in <strong>Sections 6.1</strong> or <strong>6.2</strong> shall be governed by this <strong>Section 6.3</strong> (e.g., text you submit in</p>
<p>comments). You grant Vimeo a perpetual and irrevocable right and license to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and display such</p>
<p>content through online means in connection with our Services. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on improving or products or services,</p>
<p>Vimeo may use your suggestions without any compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong>6.5 Scope of Licenses</strong></p>
<p>All licenses granted by you in this <strong>Section 6</strong>: (a) are non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free; (b) include the right and license to copy,</p>
<p>use, distribute, publicly perform, and display the licensed work for the purposes stated above; and (c) include all necessary rights and</p>
<p>licenses to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations. By granting these licenses, you waive any so-called “moral rights”</p>
<p>that you may have. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a license “condition” applicable to Vimeo; rather, any breach of a term by</p>
<p>Vimeo hereof shall give rise to, at most, a claim for breach of contract only. All licenses granted herein are in addition to any other</p>
<p>licenses that you may grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).</p>
<p><strong>7. Your Obligations</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1 Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
<p>For each piece of content that you submit to or through Vimeo, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<p>You have the right to submit the content to Vimeo and grant the licenses herein;</p>
<p>Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party with respect to the streaming or other</p>
<p>permitted distribution of the content;</p>
<p>The content does not, and will not, infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and</p>
<p>The content complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents,</p>
<p>from and against all third-party actions arising from: (a) the content you submit to or through the Services; and (b) allegations of actions or</p>
<p>omissions by you that (regardless if proven) would constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8. Term and Termination</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement begins when you first use our Services and continues so long as you use our Service or have an account with us,</p>
<p>whichever is longer. Paid accounts will continue for the subscription period and will renew in accordance with <strong>Section 4</strong> above. With</p>
<p>respect to Basic (free) memberships, Vimeo may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice, and</p>
<p>users may terminate at any time by deleting their accounts.</p>
<p>If you breach this Agreement, Vimeo may, at its option: (a) terminate this Agreement immediately, with or without advance written notice;</p>
<p>(b) suspend, delete, or limit access to your account or any content within it; and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable law, retain any</p>
<p>amounts payable to you (which you forfeit). If Vimeo deletes your account for breach, you may not re-register.</p>
<p>In the event of any termination or expiration, the following sections will survive: <strong>Section 7.2</strong> (Indemnification), <strong>Section 9</strong> (Disclaimers),</p>
<p><strong>Section 10</strong> (Limitation of Liability), and <strong>Section 11</strong> (General Provisions).</p>
<p><strong>9. Disclaimers</strong></p>
<p>VIMEO PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>You must provide your own device and Internet access.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VIMEO DISCLAIMS</p>
<p>ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Among other things, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:</p>
<p>That our Services, or any part thereof, will be available or permitted in your jurisdiction, uninterrupted or error-free, or accessible</p>
<p>from all devices or browsers;</p>
<p>Concerning any content submitted by our users;</p>
<p>That any geo-filtering or digital rights management solution that we might offer will be effective;</p>
<p>That our Services will meet your business or professional needs;</p>
<p>That we will continue to support any particular feature or maintain backwards compatibility with any third-party software or device;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Concerning any third-party websites and resources.</p>
<p><strong>10. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) VIMEO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,</p>
<p>SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS,</p>
<p>GOODWILL, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; AND (B) VIMEO'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, EXCEPT FOR VIMEO’S</p>
<p>CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER (IF ANY), SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO VIMEO</p>
<p>OVER THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING YOUR CLAIM(S) OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD \$100), WHICHEVER IS</p>
<p>GREATER.</p>
<p><strong>11. General Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choice of Law:</strong> This Agreement will be governed by the laws of New York State and the United States of America (with respect to</p>
<p>matters subject to federal jurisdiction such as copyright), without regard to principles of conflicts of law.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Venue; Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> Any action relating to this Agreement or your use of our Services must be commenced in the state</p>
<p>or federal courts located in New York County, New York State, United States of America; you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those</p>
<p>courts. IN ANY SUCH ACTION, VIMEO AND YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
<p><strong>Reservation of Rights, Severability, Force Majeure:</strong> Vimeo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein. Vimeo’s rights and</p>
<p>remedies are cumulative. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right. If any term of this</p>
<p>Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be limited or severed. Vimeo will not be</p>
<p>liable for any delay or failure caused by a force majeure event.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship:</strong> You and Vimeo are independent contractors of one another; neither party is an agent, partner, or joint venturer of the other.</p>
<p>This Agreement binds the parties and their successors, personal representatives, and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement to any</p>
<p>person whose account has been terminated by Vimeo or who is prohibited from registering; any such assignment will be void.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties:</strong> We may provide links to and integrations with websites operated by others. The website operator, not Vimeo, is solely</p>
<p>responsible for the content thereof, and your use of each such website will be subject to its terms of service. We may disable integrations</p>
<p>with any third party at any time, with or without notice. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement confers any right on</p>
<p>any third party.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior understandings</p>
<p>regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except in accordance with <strong>Section 1</strong> or in a document executed by</p>
<p>authorized representatives of Vimeo. If you have a signed agreement with Vimeo, any conflicting term of that agreement will prevail over</p>
<p>the terms hereof, but only as to the subject matter of that agreement.</p>
