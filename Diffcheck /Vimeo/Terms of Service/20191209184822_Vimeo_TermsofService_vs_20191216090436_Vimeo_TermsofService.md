<span style="background-color: green;">current </span>subscription period. Vimeo may decline renewals.


**Lapse Policy:** When a subscription ends, the account will, at Vimeo’s option, revert to <span style="background-color: green;">Basic (</span>free<span style="background-color: green;">)</span> account status or will be deleted. Any<span style="background-color: red;"> content</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">content </span>in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

By submitting a video, you grant Vimeo permission to:


Stream the video to end users;


Embed the video on third-party websites;


Distribute the video via our APIs;


Make the video available for download;


Transcode the video (create compressed versions of your video file that are optimized for streaming); and

If you have enabled a video privacy setting or disabled downloading or embedding, we will limit distribution of your video pursuant to your


selection. By enabling access to your video to any third party, you grant each such person permission to stream (and/or download or


embed, as applicable) your video. For the purposes of this **Section 6.1**, your video includes its title, description, tags, and other

other legal claim; or (c) when Vimeo in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.

**<span style="background-color: green;">11.3 Arbitration of Privacy Claims; Class Action Waiver**


The exclusive means of resolving any Covered Privacy Claim (defined below) shall be BINDING A</span>R<span style="background-color: green;">BITRATION. Th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">se</span><span style="background-color: green;"> a</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">bitration will be


administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, as modified by our Arbitration Procedures. If you


are a consumer, as defined by JAMS in its Consumer Minimum Standards, you may request that the arbitration hearing be conducted in


the area in which you reside. Otherwise, the hearing (if any) shall take place in New York County, New York State, United States of


America. EACH PARTY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, TO A TRIAL BY JURY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,


CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY COVERED PRIVACY CLAIM.


**O</span>v<span style="background-color: red;">at</span><span style="background-color: green;">erv</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">on</span><span style="background-color: green;">ew:**</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Arb</span><span style="background-color: red;">of R</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">gh</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ration provide</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> a private dispute resolution process that is usually more streamlined and less formal than litigation. In an


arbitration</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">your rights will be determined by a neutral third party called an arbitrator, and not a judge or jury. Both you and Vimeo are


entitled to fundamentally fair proceedings at every stage of the arbitration, including the hearing. The arbitrator will decide all issues


relating to the dispute, including the question of arbitrability, and can grant any relief that a court could grant. Decisions by the arbitrator


are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our


Arbitration Procedures.


**Definitions:** A “**Covered Privacy Claim**��? means any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to (a) Vimeo’s collection, use,


storage, analysis, or transfer of your Personal Information; (b) an alleged breach of our Privacy Policy; (c) an alleged data breach or


unauthorized disclosure of data or content; or (d) an allegation that Vimeo failed to comply with any privacy or data security right or


obligation. “**Personal Information**��? means any information about you, including your registration information (e.g., email address),


payment information, location information, device information, biometric identifiers or information, IP address, and your activities


(including viewing and search history), but does not include content that you upload (except to the extent the content contains personal


information about you).


**</span>S<span style="background-color: red;">everability, Force Majeure:** Vi</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">eo reserves </span>all <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">rights not express</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">y gr</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">nted here</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">n. Vi</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">eo’</span>s <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">rights and


remedies are cumulative. N</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> fail</span>ur<span style="background-color: red;">e or delay by Vimeo in exercising any righ</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> will waive any further exercise of that right. If any term of this


Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be limited or severed. Vimeo will not be


liable for any delay or failure caused by a force majeure event.


**Relationship:** You and Vimeo are independent contractors of one another; neither party is an agent, partner, or joint venturer of the other.


This Agreement binds the parties and their successors, personal representatives, and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement to any


person whose account has been terminated by Vimeo or who is prohibited from registering; any such assignment will be void.


**Third Parties:** We may provide links to and integrations with websites operated by others. The website operator, not Vimeo, is solely


responsible for the content thereof, and your use of each such website will be subject to its terms of service. We may disable integrations


with any third party at any time, with or without notice.</span> Except<span style="background-color: green;">ion:**</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">Notwith</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">tanding the above, each party has the right to bring an individual Covered Privacy Claim


against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 1 of JAMS’ Minimum Consumer Standards. If one party


files an arbitration that could be litigated in such a small claims court, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small


claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall


be administratively closed. If requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall administratively close the arbitration so


long as the proceedings are at an early stage and no hearing has occurred.


**12. General Provisions**


**Reservation of Rights, Severability, Force Majeure:** Vimeo reserves all rights not</span> expressly <span style="background-color: green;">g</span><span style="background-color: red;">stated he</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ant</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">d here</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">n.

regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except in accordance with **Section 1** or in a document executed by
