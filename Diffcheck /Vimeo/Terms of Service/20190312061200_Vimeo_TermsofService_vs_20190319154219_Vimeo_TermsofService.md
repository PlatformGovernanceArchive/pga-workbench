**5. Subscriptions and Purchases**


**SUBSCRIPTIONS:** In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer paid subscriptions. Please see our subscription

We reserve the right to charge for excessive use of bandwidth where plays occur on third-party sites and applications outside the native


Vimeo player or apps. Anyone who wishes to obtain storage capacity beyond what is offered with a particular subscription, or additional


bandwidth for applications not using the Vimeo player may request a custom account by contacting us here: join.vimeo.com/custom.


Additional terms and conditions (to be shown prior to purchase) apply to custom accounts. All fees may be subject to taxes.

**subscription period unless cancelled beforehand. Monthly plans renew for 30-day periods. Annual plans renew for one-year**

usage limits do not roll over.


**How to Decline Renewal:** **Self-Serve customers may opt out of automatic renewal by changing their account settings.**


**Enterprise customers may opt out according to the** Enterprise Terms**.** Any opt-out or notice of non-renewal will not affect the current

in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your content.


Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of any content. We may publish additional guidelines regarding the treatment of lapsed


subscriptions. These guidelines describe current practices only and shall not require Vimeo to provide any level of post-subscription


account status.

prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription. Vimeo reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for


any reason. Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription periods.


**END OF SUBSCRIPTION:** When a paid subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a Basic (free) account and Vimeo may


disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits. If you're using Vimeo for commercial purposes, you will need


to maintain a Vimeo PRO or higher plan to continue hosting your videos. Your account and its content may be deleted if your subscription


is not renewed.

and to other terms and conditions that are presented to you at the time of purchase.

inactive (i.e., the user fails to log in) for a continuous period of at least six (6) months. Paid subscription accounts will remain active until


the end of the subscription term and any renewal term.


**TERMINATION FOR BREACH:** Vimeo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any


content you submitted if Vimeo determines that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would


tend to damage Vimeo's reputation and goodwill. If Vimeo deletes your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the


Vimeo Service. Vimeo may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.


**EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION:** Upon termination, all licenses granted by Vimeo will terminate. Sections 6 and 11


though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion for any reason, content that you submitted may no longer be available.


Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of such content.

embed, as applicable) your video. For the purposes of this **Section 6.1**, your video includes its title, description, tags, and other


metadata.
