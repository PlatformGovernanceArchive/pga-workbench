<p>mature subject matter. If you are under 18, do not view such content.</p>
<p><strong>2. License to Use the Vimeo Service</strong></p>

<p>or sublicensed to anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>COMMERCIAL USE:</strong> You may not use the Vimeo Service for commercial purposes unless:</p>

<p>otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT SECURITY:</strong> You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorized users. You</p>
<p>must not allow others to use your account. You must safeguard the confidentiality of your password. If you are using a computer that others</p>

<p>account, you must change your password and <strong>notify us immediately</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Subscriptions and Purchases</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIMEO PLUS AND PRO:</strong> In addition to offering Basic (free) Vimeo memberships, we offer Vimeo Plus and Vimeo PRO subscriptions. Please</p>
<p>see our subscription pages for current <strong>Plus</strong> and <strong>PRO</strong> features and pricing. Features and prices are subject to change. Storage limits are</p>
<p>calculated based upon source files. We may also offer add-on features and packages. Vimeo PRO users who wish to obtain additional</p>
<p>storage may request a<span style="background-color: red;">n</span> <span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">enterprise sol</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">m accou</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">t</span> by contacting us here: <strong>vimeo.com/help/contact</strong><span style="background-color: green;">.

<p>prior to the commencement of a renewal subscription. Vimeo reserves the right to deny subscriptions, renewals, and other purchases for</p>
<p>any reason. PRO subscriptions offered beginning on October 15, 2013 may not be available to existing users whose storage as of that date</p>
<p>exceeds the yearly maximum for a PRO account. Unused storage, plays, and other limits do not roll over to subsequent subscription</p>
<p>periods.</p>
<p><strong>END OF SUBSCRIPTION:</strong> When a Vimeo Plus or PRO subscription ends, the account automatically becomes a Basic (free) account and</p>
<p>Vimeo may disable access to or delete any content to comply with Basic account limits.<span style="background-color: green;"> When a custom subscription ends, the account and</p>
<p>its content will be deleted if the subscription is not renewed.</span></p>
<p><strong>OTHER PURCHASES:</strong> Purchases of other products and services through the Vimeo Service <span style="background-color: red;">m</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;">y b</span>e subject to o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">the</span>r <span style="background-color: green;"><strong>P</span><span style="background-color: red;">terms </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">yme</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d condi</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">io</span><span style="background-color: green;"> Adde</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">dum</strong> and to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">other terms and conditions </span>that are presented to you at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>6. Term and Termination; Account Deletion</strong></p>
<p><strong>TERM:</strong> This Agreement begins on the date you first use the Vimeo Service and continues as long as you have an account with us.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> You may delete your account at any time. Basic accounts may be deleted from the Vimeo Service if they remain</p>
<p>inactive (i.e., the user fails to log in) for a continuous period of at least six (6) months. Subscription accounts will remain active until the end</p>
<p>of the subscription term and any renewal term.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINATION FOR BREACH:</strong> Vimeo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any content</p>
<p>you submitted if Vimeo determines that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to</p>
<p>damage Vimeo's reputation and goodwill. If Vimeo deletes your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the Vimeo</p>
<p>Service. Vimeo may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
<p><strong>EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong> Upon termination, all licenses granted by Vimeo will terminate. Sections 6 and 11</p>
<p>though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion for any reason, content that you submitted may no longer be available.</p>
<p>Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of such content.</p>
<p><strong>7. Content Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload, post, or transmit (collectively, "submit") any video, image, text, audio recording, or other work (collectively, "content")</p>

<p>Violates any law.</p>
<p>All videos you submit must also comply with the <strong>Vimeo Guidelines</strong>, which are incorporated into this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8. Code of Conduct</strong></p>

<p><strong>9. Licenses Granted by You</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Videos</strong></p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO VIMEO:</strong> As between you and Vimeo, you own the video content ("videos") that you submit to the Vimeo Service. By submitting</p>
<p>a video, you grant Vimeo and its affiliates a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute,</p>
<p>publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your video for the</p>
<p>purpose of (i) displaying the video within the Vimeo Service; (ii) displaying the video on third party websites and applications through a video</p>
<p>embed or Vimeo's API subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) allowing other users to play, download, and embed on third party websites</p>
<p>the video, subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) promoting the Vimeo Service, provided that you have made the video publicly available;</p>
<p>and (iv) archiving or preserving the video for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.</p>
<p><strong>LICENSE TO OTHER USERS:</strong> You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your videos for their personal, non-</p>
<p>commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the videos solely to the extent necessary to view the</p>
<p>videos. The foregoing licenses are in addition to any license you may decide to grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).</p>
<p><strong>DURATION OF LICENSES:</strong> The above licenses will continue unless and until you remove your videos from the Vimeo Service, in which case</p>
<p>the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal</p>
<p>archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely. Please note that removed videos may be cached in search engine indices after</p>
<p>removal and that Vimeo has no control over such caching.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Non-video Content</strong></p>
<p>As between you and Vimeo, you own all non-video content that you submit to the Vimeo Service. You grant Vimeo and its affiliates a</p>
<p>worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and display</p>
<p>(through all media now known or hereafter created), and make derivative works from your non-video content. In addition, you waive any so-</p>
<p>called "moral rights" in your non-video content. You further grant all users of the Vimeo Service permission to view your non-video content</p>
<p>for their personal, non-commercial purposes. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on improving or adding new features to the Vimeo Service,</p>
<p>Vimeo shall have the right to use your suggestions without any compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong>10. Your Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
<p>For each piece of content that you submit, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the right to submit the content to Vimeo and grant</p>
<p>the licenses set forth above; (ii) Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party; (iii) the content</p>
<p>does not infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and (iv) the content complies with this</p>
<p>Agreement and all applicable laws.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Agreement and all applicable laws.</p>
<p></span><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all third</p>
<p>party actions that: (i) arise from your activities on the Vimeo Service; (ii) assert a violation by you of any term of this Agreement; or (iii)</p>
<p>assert that any content you submitted to Vimeo violates any law or infringes any third party right, including any intellectual property or</p>
<p>privacy right.</p>
<p><strong>12. Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please send us a notice as</p>
<p>set forth in our <strong>Copyright and DMCA Policy</strong>, which is incorporated into this Agreement. For other intellectual property claims, please send</p>
<p>us a notice at legal[at]vimeo[dot]com.</p>
<p><strong>13. Disclaimers</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo reserves the right to modify the Vimeo Service. You are responsible for providing your own access (e.g., computer, mobile device,</p>
<p>Internet connection, etc.) to the Vimeo Service. Vimeo has no obligation to screen or monitor any content and does not guarantee that any</p>
<p>content available on the Vimeo Service complies with this Agreement or is suitable for all users.</p>
<p>Vimeo provides the Vimeo Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis. You therefore use the Vimeo Service at your own risk. Vimeo</p>
<p>expressly disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of</p>
<p>merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any other warranty that might arise under any law. Without limiting</p>
<p>the foregoing, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be permitted in your jurisdiction;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;</p>
<p>Concerning any content submitted by any member;</p>
<p>Concerning any third party's use of content that you submit;</p>
<p>That any content you submit will be made available on the Vimeo Service or will be stored by Vimeo;</p>
<p>That the Vimeo Service will meet your business or professional needs;</p>
<p>That Vimeo will continue to support any particular feature of the Vimeo Service; or</p>
<p>Concerning sites and resources outside of the Vimeo Service, even if linked to from the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p>To the extent any disclaimer or limitation of liability does not apply, all applicable express, implied, and statutory warranties will be limited in</p>
<p>duration to a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which you first used the Vimeo Service, and no warranties shall apply after such</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p><strong>14. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) Vimeo shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential,</strong></p>
<p><strong>or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses;</strong></p>
<p><strong>and (ii) Vimeo's total liability to you shall not exceed the amounts paid by you to Vimeo over the twelve (12) months preceding</strong></p>
<p><strong>your claim(s).</strong></p>
<p><strong>15. Compliance Notice Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2257</strong></p>
<p>All pictures, graphics, videos, and other visual media displayed on the Vimeo Service are exempt from 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75</p>
<p>because they do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2256 (2) (A) - (D), but are merely, at most,</p>
<p>depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual</p>
<p>depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995. Vimeo is not the primary producer of the visual content contained in the Vimeo Service.</p>
<p><strong>16. General Provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW:</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to</p>
<p>principles of conflicts of law. The Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, and the United Nations</p>
<p>Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p>
<p><strong>DISPUTES:</strong> Any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Vimeo Service must be commenced in the state or</p>
<p>federal courts located in New York County, New York, United States of America (and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts). In any</p>
<p>such action, Vimeo and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
