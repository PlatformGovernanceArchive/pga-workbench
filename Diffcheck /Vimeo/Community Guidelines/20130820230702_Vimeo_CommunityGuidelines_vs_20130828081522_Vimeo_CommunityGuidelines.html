<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“I have permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">insult </span>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while<span style="background-color: red;"> you are on</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">you are on </span>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free<span style="background-color: red;"> to disagree and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">to disagree and </span>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to someone's face,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
