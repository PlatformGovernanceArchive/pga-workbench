A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).

**Video Guidelines**


**<span style="background-color: green;">V</span><span style="background-color: red;">Commerc</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">al C</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ntent Guide</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">at</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">o</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>s**


**Be cool and play nice.**


The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility


for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their


videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.


**Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.**


The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and


channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass


messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a


robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.


**Don’t be a creep.**


Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with


comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make


sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate


any other person or business.<span style="background-color: red;">


If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</span>


**Upload only videos you created yourself.**


You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.


“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.


You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)


as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.


Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.


**Exception!** <span style="background-color: green;">M</span><span style="background-color: red;">Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business m</span>embers <span style="background-color: green;">with paid subscriptions </span>can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>necessary rights<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>and permissions.


**You cannot upload certain types of content:**


No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.


No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)


<span style="background-color: green;">You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.


</span>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read


more.


No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.


No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.

**OUR COMMUNITY**


Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded


individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of


real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and


contribute in positive ways.

**There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.**


You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.


You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.


You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.


**Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.**


Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,


by flooding search results) should remain private.


If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.


Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.


**Private Mode:** PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or


through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.


**Businesses in the Vimeo Community:**


Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional


purposes.


Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a


violation
