**Help Center** **/ Vimeo Guidelines**


A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).


**Community Guidelines**


**Video Guidelines**


**Commercial Content Guidelines**


**Be cool and play nice.**


The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility


for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their


videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.


**Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.**


The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join **groups**, follow other members


and **channels** related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass


messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a


robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.


**Don’t be a creep.**


Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with


comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make


sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate


any other person or business.


If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our **Commercial Content Guidelines** as well. Thanks!


**Upload only videos you created yourself.**


You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.


“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.


You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)


as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.


Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.


**Exception!** **Vimeo PRO** <span style="background-color: green;">and **Vimeo Business** </span>members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>necessary rights and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>permissions.


**You cannot upload certain types of content:**


No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about **copyright** and **fair use**.


No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. **Read more**.)


No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. **Read**


**more**.


No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. **Read more**.


**Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or** **Vimeo Plus** **to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload**

**OUR COMMUNITY**


Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded


individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of


real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and


contribute in positive ways.
