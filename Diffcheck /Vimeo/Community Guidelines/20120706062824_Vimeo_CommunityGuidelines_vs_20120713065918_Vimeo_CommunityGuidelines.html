<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Speech Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the</p>
<p>means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their</p>
<p>words. We insist that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you</p>
<p>encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and provide critical</p>
<p>feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner,</p>
<p>you will be banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so</p>
<p>you can rack up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people,</p>
<p>and so we strongly encourage you to find people who share your interests and</p>
<p>connect with them. The more you interact with others, the more others will be</p>
<p>interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>
