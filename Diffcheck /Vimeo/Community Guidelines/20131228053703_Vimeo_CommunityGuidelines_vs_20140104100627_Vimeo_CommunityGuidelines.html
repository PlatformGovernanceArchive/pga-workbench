<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p>Thanks a billion for being a part of Vimeo and helping us keep the Internet’s most awesome community of creative people really, uh,</p>
<p>awesome. (You guys are the creative people — come up with something better!)</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>want to upload videos with a commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your</p>
<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, author, artist, or non-profit, you</p>
<p>may use any account type (Basic, Plus, or PRO).</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), affiliate programs,</p>
<p>get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home gigs, or similar ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience</strong></p>
<p><strong>should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that</p>
<p>adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g., by flooding search results) should remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading scores of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please</p>
<p>keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO members can use <strong>Private Mode</strong> to easily hide their videos from</p>
<p>Vimeo.com. <strong>Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or</p>
<p>the Vimeo Forum for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo</p>
<p>account. <strong>Learn how to report a violation</strong></p>
