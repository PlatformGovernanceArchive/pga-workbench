<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</span></p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <span style="background-color: green;">M</span><span style="background-color: red;">Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business m</span>embers <span style="background-color: green;">with paid subscriptions </span>can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>necessary rights<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p></span>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>
