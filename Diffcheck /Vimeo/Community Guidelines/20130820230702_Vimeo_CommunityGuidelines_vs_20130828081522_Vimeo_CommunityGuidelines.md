**Uploading Guidelines**


**1. I will upload only videos I created myself.**


You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.


“I have permission” does not mean you created it.


Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have


contributed significantly.


Public domain videos are not allowed.


Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.


**2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.**


Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or **Vimeo Plus** accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,


however, use a **Vimeo PRO** account to host their videos so long as they comply with the **Vimeo PRO**


**guidelines**.


Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and


actors who want to promote the work they have created.


You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given


prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them


will be removed.


You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,


work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.


You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.


Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.


We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have


coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.


**3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.**


You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.


You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful


acts or extreme violence.


You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only


your involvement in the program.


You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.


You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are


allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.


Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in


the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game


trailers are permitted.

The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to<span style="background-color: red;"> insult</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">insult </span>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while<span style="background-color: red;"> you are on</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">you are on </span>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free<span style="background-color: red;"> to disagree and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to disagree and </span>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>to someone's face,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>manner, you will be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>banished forever.


<span style="background-color: red;">**Go forth and connect**


</span>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack<span style="background-color: red;"> up</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">up </span>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly<span style="background-color: red;"> encourage you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">encourage you </span>to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>interact with others,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
