**Community</span> Guidelines**


**<span style="background-color: green;">Video Guidelines**


**</span>Commercial Content Guideline<span style="background-color: green;">s**


**Be cool and play nice.**


The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility


for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their


videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.


**Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.**


The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on


other people’s videos, follow people, join **Groups**, and follow **Channels** related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited


mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt


people’s experience here.


If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our **Commercial Content Guidelines** as well. Thanks!


**Upload only videos you created yourself.**


You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.


“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.


You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)


as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.


Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.


**Exception!** **Vimeo PRO** members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and


permissions.


**You cannot upload certain types of content:**


No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about **copyright** and **fair use**.


No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. **Read more**.)


No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. **Read more**.


No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals.


**Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or** **Vimeo Plus** **to host videos. If you want to upload videos with a**


**commercial intent, you must use** **Vimeo PRO****.**


Commercial content includes:


Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.


Videos containing any form of advertising.


Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your company’s website).


Content that you intend to sell.
