**A few words about our community**


Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments


from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive


community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your


own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.


**Uploading Guidelines**


**1. I will upload only videos I created myself.**


You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.


"I have permission" does not mean you created it.


Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which<span style="background-color: red;"> they have</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">they have </span>contributed significantly.


Public domain videos are not allowed.


Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.


**2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.**


Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or **Vimeo Plus** accounts to host their videos. Businesses<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>may,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video<span style="background-color: red;"> unless given</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">unless given </span>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with<span style="background-color: red;"> advertisements in them</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">advertisements in them </span>will be removed.

Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.


We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who<span style="background-color: red;"> have</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">have </span>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.


**3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.**

**Speech Guidelines**<span style="background-color: green;">


The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult


and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on


Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and


provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,


don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be


banished forever.</span>

views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you


to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,


the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!
