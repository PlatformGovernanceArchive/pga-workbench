</span>**A few words about our community**


Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments


from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive


community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your


own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.

</span>T<span style="background-color: red;">he Internet is a w</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the </span>m<span style="background-color: red;">eans to insult


and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on


Vi</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">eo </span>y<span style="background-color: red;">ou respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,


don't say it on Vimeo. </span>A<span style="background-color: red;">nd if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be
