<p><strong>THE VIMEO COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who</p>
<p>wanted to share their creative work and</p>
<p>personal moments from their lives. As time</p>
<p>went on, likeminded people discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community of</p>
<p>individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope</p>
<p>that this environment fuels your own creativity and</p>
<p>inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in</p>
<p>positive ways.</p>

<p>Our practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“I have permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works</p>
<p>to which they have contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos.</p>
<p>Businesses may, however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as</p>
<p>they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists,</p>
<p>musicians, nonprofits, and actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after</p>
<p>the video unless given prior written permission from an authorized member of the</p>
<p>Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick</p>
<p>schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-</p>
<p>making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate</p>
<p>walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for</p>
<p>businesses who have coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other</p>
<p>partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is</p>
<p>allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory</p>
<p>speech; or depict unlawful acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and</p>
<p>the video depicts only your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs</p>
<p>or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima</p>
<p>videos with a story are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to</p>
<p>avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they</p>
<p>cite their involvement in the video description (maps and mods to commercial games</p>
<p>are not allowed). No commercial video game trailers are permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to</p>
<p>insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while</p>
<p>you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free</p>
<p>to disagree and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it</p>
<p>to someone's face, don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful</p>
<p>manner, you will be banished forever.</p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack</p>
<p>up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly</p>
<p>encourage you to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you</p>
<p>interact with others, the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get</p>
<p>involved!</p>
