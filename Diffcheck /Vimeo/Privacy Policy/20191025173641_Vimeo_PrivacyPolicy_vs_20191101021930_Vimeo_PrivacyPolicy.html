<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who we are and what we do</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Vimeo, Inc. and its subsidiaries including Livestream LLC (collectively, <strong>"Vimeo," "we" "us"</strong> or <strong>"our"</strong>). We</p>
<p>provide online video sharing and related services through our websites, including Vimeo.com and Livestream.com, our branded applications</p>
<p>for mobile and connected devices, and our embeddable video players.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance and Changes</strong></p>
<p>By registering for, downloading, or using our services, you accept this Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service. We may modify</p>
<p>this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any modified version of our Privacy Policy at https://vimeo.com/privacy. If we change the</p>
<p>Privacy Policy in a way that materially lessens our commitments to you, we will provide notice to registered users by email or other methods.</p>
<p><strong>2. Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals who are under the minimum required ages specified herein. You must be</p>
<p>at least 13 years old to create an account. If you reside in the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old or the age of majority in</p>
<p>your jurisdiction, whichever is greater. Individuals under the applicable age may use our services only through a parent or legal guardian's</p>
<p>account and with their involvement. If you are a parent or legal guardian who believes your child has provided personal information to Vimeo</p>
<p>without your consent, you may ask us to delete such information by contacting us at privacy@vimeo.com.</p>

<p>We collect information about you when you use our services. In addition, third parties may collect information about you when you use our</p>
<p>services. Collected information may include or reflect personal information that could identify you, as well as non-personal information. We</p>
<p>refer to your information as <strong>"your data"</strong> for short.</p>
<p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
<p>To create an account, you must provide a valid email address and password. If you choose to sign-up and/or authenticate using a third-</p>
<p>party account (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), you authorize us to obtain account information from the third-party platform.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information</strong></p>
<p>To make a purchase, you may need to provide a valid payment method (e.g., credit card or PayPal account). Your payment information will</p>
<p>be collected and processed by our authorized payment vendors. We do not directly collect or store credit or debit card numbers ourselves</p>
<p>in the ordinary course of processing transactions. If we allow purchase through a third-party platform (i.e. in-app purchase), the payment</p>
<p>method stored with the third-party platform will be charged.</p>
<p>If you wish to sell items or earn money from advertising through our services, you must provide an account to receive funds and tax</p>
<p>information, which may include your name, address, and taxpayer identification number.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>Accountholders may create a profile and upload content such as videos, text, photographs, and artwork. Your profile may display</p>
<p>information about you and your activities. This information may be accessed by others. Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed</p>
<p>by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.) are viewable by others. Your interactions with other users (e.g.,</p>
<p>comments, "likes," private messages) may be seen by others. You may choose to limit the availability of your profile and videos. For more</p>
<p>details, see <strong>Section 9</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information You May Submit</strong></p>
<p>You may submit data to us for limited purposes such as requesting customer support; answering a questionnaire; participating in a study;</p>
<p>entering contests or sweepstakes; or signing up to receive communications from us or another user.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically-Collected Information</strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect certain types of data when you use our services, regardless of whether you have an account. This data includes</p>
<p>your IP address, technical information about your device (e.g., browser type, operating system, basic device information), the web page you</p>
<p>visited or search query you entered before reaching us, and your activities. We may track your activities using cookies and similar</p>
<p>technologies. By using our services, you agree to our use of these methods as set forth in our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Products</strong></p>
<p>We collect your shipping address to send you products you have ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Some third parties may collect data about you when you use our services. This may include data you submit (such as payment information)</p>
<p>or automatically-collected information (in the case of third-party analytics providers and advertisers).</p>
<p>We may obtain data from third parties about you. We may combine that data with information that we have collected. For example, some</p>
<p>advertisers or advertising platforms may allow us to determine what other online services you might use so that we may place relevant ads</p>
<p>on those services.</p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Data</strong></p>
<p>We may use your data for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Identification and authentication:</strong> We use your data to verify you when you access your account.</p>
<p><strong>Operating our services:</strong> We use your data to provide our services, process and fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to</p>
<p>otherwise comply with our contractual obligations to you. We (and/or our third-party vendors) use your financial information to</p>
<p>process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts you have earned.</p>
<p><strong>Communicating with you:</strong> We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer support or</p>
<p>other inquiry).</p>
<p><strong>Improving our services:</strong> We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them. In</p>
<p>general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a</p>
<p>specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).</p>
<p><strong>Customizing your experience:</strong> We use your data to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering your</p>
<p>preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing and advertising:</strong> We use your data to display ads and send you offers. We may also use your data in delivering third-</p>
<p>party advertisements to you. This may include "targeted ads" based upon your activities.</p>
<p><strong>Exercising our rights:</strong> Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our</p>
<p><strong>Exercising our rights:</strong> Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our</p>
<p>service. For example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For example, we may need to gather your data to</p>
<p>respond to a subpoena or court order.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting your information:</strong> Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.</p>
<p>We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.</p>
<p>Whenever we process your data for one of these purposes, we have determined that one or more of the following lawful bases apply:</p>
<p>Performance of a contract;</p>
<p>Legitimate commercial interest;</p>
<p>Compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
<p>Consent</p>
<p>If you require further information about the balancing test that Vimeo has undertaken to justify its reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful</p>
<p>basis of processing, see <strong>Section 15</strong> for information on how to contact us.</p>
<p><strong>5. With Whom We Share Your Data</strong></p>
<p>We share data with third parties as follows:</p>
<p><strong>As you instruct:</strong> We may make your profile and videos available to others as you instruct in using our services. We may share your</p>
<p>data with persons to whom you have granted account-level access.</p>
<p><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share your data with third parties where we have obtained your express consent to do so. You may</p>
<p>revoke these consents.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized vendors:</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors that help us operate our services, process orders, and</p>
<p>comply with your instructions and our contractual obligations. This includes payment processors, content delivery networks (CDNs),</p>
<p>cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers, quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse</p>
<p>prevention vendors, customer relations management (CRM) vendors, and shipment vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> We may share your data with advertising companies to display relevant ads to you. Unless you expressly agree, we will</p>
<p>not share or sell your name, email address, or physical address with such persons.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may share your data with persons who provide analytics showing how customers are using our services.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and advisors:</strong> We may share your data with our parent company, IAC/InterActiveCorp, and our auditors and advisors for</p>
<p>planning, financial reporting, accounting, auditing, tax filings, and legal compliance. Unless you expressly agree, we will not share</p>
<p>your data with our parent or any affiliate for other purposes, such as direct marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Certain legal situations:</strong> We may share your data where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in</p>
<p>connection with a corporate transaction as discussed in Section 6.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated or anonymized information:</strong> We may publicly disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as</p>
<p>our number of visitors and registered users.</p>
<p>We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security practices. We require that such vendors agree to protect the</p>
<p>data we share.</p>
<p><strong>6. Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.)</p>
<p>("requests") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings. We direct law enforcement agencies to our Law</p>
<p>Enforcement Guidelines page.</p>
<p>We handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law. If the request originates from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose</p>
<p>information where we in good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law. In all cases, we may raise or waive any</p>
<p>legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk. For example, if we become aware of a person</p>
<p>threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.</p>
<p>We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing</p>
<p>and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.</p>
<p>We may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users. If you submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act</p>
<p>(DMCA) or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user. If you challenge such a notice, we may share your</p>
<p>response with the complainant.</p>
<p>We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by</p>
<p>a third party. In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>7. Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We retain your data for as long as you have an account. When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos. We may</p>
<p>retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you;</p>
<p>and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a business reason for retaining data,</p>
<p>we will delete or anonymize it.</p>
<p>We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion. Once we delete a video, we may not be</p>
<p>able to recover it. If you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for</p>
<p>a time. We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.</p>
<p>If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply</p>
<p>with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or</p>
<p>assert our rights.</p>
<p><strong>8. Your Privacy Choices</strong></p>
<p>We enable you to make numerous choices about your data:</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with certain information. For example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide</p>
<p>optional account information.</p>
<p>You may change your account and video privacy settings. See <strong>Section 9</strong> for more details.</p>
<p>You may change or correct information voluntarily submitted to us. We encourage you to keep your data current by viewing your</p>
<p>settings page.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us. See <strong>Section 10</strong> for more details.</p>
<p>You may limit the use of cookies. See our Cookie Policy for options.</p>
<p>You may backup your videos.</p>
<p>You may close your account (which will delete all videos) or delete certain videos.</p>
<p>Users from certain countries may have additional rights. See <strong>Section 14</strong> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>9. Account and Video Privacy Settings</strong></p>
<p>Our video hosting and sharing tools offer the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos. This section explains some</p>
<p>of your choices.</p>
<p><strong>Profile</strong></p>
<p>Some of our online subscription plans enable you to "hide" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website. Your profile will,</p>
<p>however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members</strong></p>
<p>Some of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others. Persons with such access ("<strong>Team Members</strong>")</p>
<p>may be able to see and potentially alter your data. You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
<p>We enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos. Your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:</p>
<p><strong>Public (or "anyone"):</strong> Your video will be publicly-available.</p>
<p><strong>Just you (i.e., "only me"):</strong> Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.</p>
<p><strong>Selected people:</strong> Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).</p>
<p><strong>Password-protected:</strong> Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.</p>
<p><strong>Private link:</strong> Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.</p>
<p>You may change these settings at any time. Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis. You should exercise caution in granting access</p>
<p>to others. Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those</p>
<p>persons may share the password and/or link with other people. Regardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the</p>
<p>right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.</p>
<p><strong>10. Communications from Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emails</strong></p>
<p>By creating an account, you consent to receive commercial emails from us. This includes newsletters and offers. Users from certain</p>
<p>countries may have the ability to opt out or opt in at the time of account creation. All users may decline to receive commercial messages in</p>
<p>their account settings. Please note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you will continue to receive transactional</p>
<p>emails from us (e.g., emails confirming transactions and/or providing information about your account).</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Device Communications</strong></p>
<p>We may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps. You may disable these by declining them or changing the app's settings.</p>
<p>To the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.</p>
<p><strong>11. Protecting Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Users</p>
<p>also have a role to play in keeping their data safe. We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account and to</p>
<p>not share it with others. You should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in</p>
<p>granting all access rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has gained access to your account</p>
<p>without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.</p>
<p><strong>12. Your Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>You may receive other people's data in using our service. If you receive information from other users, you must comply with all laws,</p>
<p>including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.</p>
<p><strong>13. Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no</p>
<p>control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website. Once on a</p>
<p>third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.</p>
<p>You may use our service through third-party sites. For example, you may watch a video that is embedded on a third-party site or use one of</p>
<p>our apps on a third-party platform. This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but does not cover any third-party site or any</p>
<p>third-party video player.</p>
<p><strong>14. International Data Transfers and Certain User Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>14.1 Location of Data</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. and</p>
<p>other countries. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the</p>
<p>U.S. and other countries. Please note that U.S. data and privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Residents of</p>
<p>certain countries may be subject to additional protections as set forth in <strong>Sections 14.2</strong> and <strong>14.3</strong> below.</p>
<p><strong>14.2 GDPR (EEA Users)</strong></p>
<p><strong>14.2 GDPR (EEA Users)</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>Section 14.2</strong> applies only to natural persons residing in the European Economic Area (for the purpose of this section only, "you" or</p>
<p>"your" shall be limited accordingly). It is Vimeo's policy to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In accordance</p>
<p>with the GDPR, we may transfer your personal information from your home country to the U.S. (or other countries) based upon the following</p>
<p>legal bases:</p>
<p>Legitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our legal obligations without transferring your</p>
<p>personal information to the U.S.</p>
<p>Our use of Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as "Model Clauses") where appropriate.</p>
<p>Our certification and adherence to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, as described further below.</p>
<p>You have the right to: opt out of non-essential cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to our use of your</p>
<p>personal information; be forgotten; port your data; and withdraw consents. We enable exercise of these rights primarily through our services</p>
<p>(which we reserve the right to modify). For example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their</p>
<p>accounts. We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests. We will endeavor to process requests within one month. Please note</p>
<p>that we may not be able to comply with requests to the extent that they would cause us to violate any law or infringe any other person's</p>
<p>rights. We reserve the right to request appropriate identification. We will process requests free of charge unless they would impose an</p>
<p>unreasonable cost on us.</p>
<p>If you have a request, complaint or inquiry, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address listed in <strong>Section 15</strong>. We are</p>
<p>committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any issue. You also have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory data</p>
<p>protection authority of your jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>14.3 Privacy Shield (EU and Swiss Users)</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>Section 14.3</strong> applies only to natural persons residing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (for the purpose of</p>
<p>this section only, "you" or "your" shall be limited accordingly). Vimeo complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.</p>
<p>Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, "<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>") as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection,</p>
<p>use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU, the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland, as applicable, to the U.S.</p>
<p>Vimeo adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement (the</p>
<p><strong>"Privacy Shield Principles"</strong>). Vimeo has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and</p>
<p>will conduct an annual internal assessment to ensure such compliance. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and</p>
<p>the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.</p>
<p>Vimeo has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy</p>
<p>Shield program, and to view Vimeo's certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov. By making this certification, Vimeo is subject to</p>
<p>the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>Where Vimeo has transferred personal information of EU, UK or Swiss residents to third parties, Vimeo shall be liable if those third parties</p>
<p>do not process personal information in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. This shall not be the case where Vimeo establishes</p>
<p>that it is not responsible for the damage caused by the third party.</p>
<p>In accordance with Privacy Shield Principles, Vimeo commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.</p>
<p>If you have inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy, you should first contact Vimeo at the address listed in <strong>Section 15</strong>. If</p>
<p>you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction,</p>
<p>please contact our independent recourse mechanism provider, JAMS, at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, to file a complaint.</p>
<p>JAMS' services are provided at no cost to you.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved complaint after contacting both Vimeo and JAMS, you may elect to arbitrate your Privacy Shield claims against</p>
<p>Vimeo pursuant to Annex I of the Privacy Shield Principles, which provides for binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association. Such arbitration will be binding upon you and Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>14.4 California User Rights</strong></p>
<p>California residents have the right to opt out of disclosing information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such third parties to directly</p>
<p>market their products and services. At this time, we do not engage in this type of disclosure. If you have questions, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>14.5 Nevada User Rights</strong></p>
<p>Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain "covered information" collected by operators of websites or online</p>
<p>services. We currently do not sell covered information, as "sale" is defined by such law, and we don't have plans to sell this information.</p>
<p>However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, you can provide us with</p>
<p>your name and email address here. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are</p>
<p>not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this information and</p>
<p>contact you if our plans change. At that time, we will create a process for verifying your identity and providing an opportunity to verified</p>
<p>consumers to complete their opt-out. Please become familiar with our data practices as set forth in this privacy policy. We may share your</p>
<p>data as explained in this privacy policy, such as to enhance your experiences and our services, and those activities will be unaffected by a</p>
<p>Nevada do not sell request.</p>
