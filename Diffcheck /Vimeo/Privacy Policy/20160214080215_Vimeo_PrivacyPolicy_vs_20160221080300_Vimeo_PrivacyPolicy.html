<p><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities</p>
<p>on our website or while using our services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal information.</em></strong> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give</p>
<p>you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>
<p><strong>Authorized service providers:</strong> We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain</p>
<p>services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing</p>
<p>customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and</p>
<p>supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have</p>
<p>access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Business partners:</strong> To the extent any personal information is contained in any video, comment or other user submission, such</p>
<p>information When you make purchases, reservations or engage in promotions offered through our website or our services, we may</p>
<p>share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests</p>
<p>and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email</p>
<p>address and other information to that merchant.</p>
<p><strong>Direct mail partners.</strong> From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may</p>
<p>be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time by clicking here.</p>
<p><strong>Other IAC businesses.</strong> We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses). We may</p>
<p>share information we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies. Sharing information with our IAC companies</p>
<p>enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.</p>
<p><strong>Other Situations.</strong> We also may disclose your information:</p>
<p>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law</p>
<p>enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as</p>
<p>otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole</p>
<p>discretion.</p>
<p>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report or take other action</p>
<p>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report or take other action</p>
<p>regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our</p>
<p>company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce</p>
<p>our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</p>
<p>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation,</p>
<p>or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and</p>
<p>disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it</p>
<p>with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit</p>
<p>the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggregated and non-personal information.</em></strong> We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above</p>
<p>circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our</p>
<p>websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information</p>
<p>collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for</p>
<p>the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the</p>
<p>most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop</p>
<p>website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of places on our website or through our services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not</p>
<p>operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a</p>
<p>website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information,</p>
<p>from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the</p>
<p>privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are</p>
<p>visiting.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Access Your Information</strong></p>
<p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your</p>
<p>account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided</p>

<p>in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account,</p>
<p>we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent</p>
<p>fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or</p>
<p>our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as</p>
<p>described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our</p>
<p>website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services;</p>
<p>participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</p>
<p>When you register on our website you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters</p>

<p>to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the following link and entering the email</p>
<p>address associated with your account: click here. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to</p>
<p>you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may</p>
<p>send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative</p>
<p>notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that, changing information in your</p>
<p>account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications</p>
<p>from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider)</p>
<p>before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that</p>
<p>third party.</p>
<p>third party.</p>
<p>You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes</p>
<p>by clicking on the following link and entering the email address associated with your account: click here.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal</p>
<p>information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal</p>
<p>information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive</p>
<p>personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your</p>
<p>personal information.</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although</p>
<p>we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other</p>
<p>communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and</p>
<p>should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at</p>
<p>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>User Submissions</strong></p>
<p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload</p>
<p>content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are</p>
<p>governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on</p>
<p>the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information</p>
<p>will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited</p>
<p>messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we</p>
<p>encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not</p>
<p>be able to edit or delete such information.</p>

<p>ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and</p>
<p>those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A</p>
<p>session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive</p>
<p>for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your</p>
<p>computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security</p>
<p>purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and</p>
<p>services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our</p>
<p>website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the</p>

<p>We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use</p>
<p>tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any</p>
<p>personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the</p>
<p>advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this</p>
<p>information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information</p>
<p>allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that</p>
<p>are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong></p>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the</p>
