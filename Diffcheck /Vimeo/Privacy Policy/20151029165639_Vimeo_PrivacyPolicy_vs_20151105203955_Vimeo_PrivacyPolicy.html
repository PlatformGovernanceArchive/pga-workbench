<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from</p>
<p>unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for</p>

<p>to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always</p>
<p>remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information</p>

<p><strong>Conditions of Use</strong>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also,</p>
<p>whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected</p>
<p>and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or</p>
<p>what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal</p>
<p>information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.</p>
