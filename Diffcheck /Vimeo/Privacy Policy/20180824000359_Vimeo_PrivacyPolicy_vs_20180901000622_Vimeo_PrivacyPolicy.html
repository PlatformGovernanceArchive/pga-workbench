<p><strong>Improving our services:</strong> We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them. In</p>
<p>general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a</p>
<p>specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).</p>

<p><strong>Exercising our rights:</strong> Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our</p>
<p>service. For example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For example, we may need to gather your data to</p>

<p>we will delete or anonymize it.</p>
<p>We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion. Once we delete a video, we may not be</p>
<p>able to recover it. If you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for</p>
<p>a time. We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.</p>
<p>If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply</p>
<p>with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or</p>
<p>assert our rights.</p>

<p><strong>9. Account and Video Privacy Settings</strong></p>
<p>Our video hosting and sharing tools offer the ability to limit the distribution of your content</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">and add</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">tio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">al demographi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">lud</span>in<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">g y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> v</span><span style="background-color: red;">mat</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">de</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> This section explains some</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">of your choices.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Profile</strong></p>
<p>Some of our online subscription plans enable you to "hide" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website. Your profile will,</p>
<p>however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members</strong></p>
<p>Some of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others. Persons with such access ("<strong>Team Members</strong>")</p>
<p>may be able to see and potentially alter your data. You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
<p>We enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos. Your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:</p>
<p><strong>Public (or "anyone"):</strong> Your video will be publicly-available.</p>
<p><strong>Just you (i.e., "only me"):</strong> Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.</p>
<p><strong>Selected people:</strong> Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).</p>
<p><strong>Password-protected:</strong> Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.</p>
<p><strong>Private link:</strong> Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.</p>
<p>You may change these settings at any time. Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis. You should exercise caution in granting access</p>
<p>to others. Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those</p>
<p>persons may share the password and/or link with other people. Regardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the</p>
<p>right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.</p>

<p><strong>How We Protect Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal</p>
<p>information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal</p>
<p>information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive</p>
<p>personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your</p>
<p>personal information.</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although</p>
<p>we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other</p>
<p>communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and</p>
<p>should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at</p>
<p>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>User Submissions</strong></p>
<p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload</p>
<p>content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are</p>
<p>governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on</p>
<p>the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information</p>
<p>will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or share it with another user,</p>
<p>you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you</p>
<p>post or otherwise share with other users, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>
<p>Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>No Rights of Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of</p>
<p>the website.</p>
