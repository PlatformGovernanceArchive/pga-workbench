<p><strong>Linked information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent</p>
<p>cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie</p>
<p>remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the</p>
<p>cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for</p>
<p>automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store</p>
<p>in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow</p>
<p>our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and</p>
<p>research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so,</p>
<p>some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p>
<p>We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These</p>
<p>companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our</p>
<p>website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are</p>
<p>using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to</p>
<p>the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that</p>
<p>information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their</p>
<p>effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising</p>
<p>Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong></p>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are</p>
<p>used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web</p>
<p>beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage</p>
<p>patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party</p>
<p>website.</p>
