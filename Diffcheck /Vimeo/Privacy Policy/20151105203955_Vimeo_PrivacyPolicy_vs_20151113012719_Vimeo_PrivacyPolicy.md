**How We Protect Your Personal Information**


We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal<span style="background-color: red;"> information from</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">information from </span>unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information, and they may do so only for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>personal information between your system and ours,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>personal information.


We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>we take steps<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other<span style="background-color: red;"> communications will always</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">communications will always </span>remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>should avoid sending personal information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at<span style="background-color: red;"> **</span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.


**User Submissions**


We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information


will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited


messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we


encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not


be able to edit or delete such information.</span>
