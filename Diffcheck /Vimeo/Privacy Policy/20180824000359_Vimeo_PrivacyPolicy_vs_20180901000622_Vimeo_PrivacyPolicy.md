or automatically-collected information (in the case of third-party analytics providers and advertisers).


We may obtain data from third parties about you. We may combine that data with information that we have collected.

**4. How We Use Your Data**


We may use your data for the following purposes:


**Identification and authentication:** We use your data to verify you when you access your account.


**Operating our services:** We use your data to provide our services, process and fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to


otherwise comply with our contractual o</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">ed </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">n </span><span style="background-color: green;">ga</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">on</span>s <span style="background-color: green;">to you. We (and/or our third-party vendors) use your financial information to


process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts you have earned.


**Communicating with you:** We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer support or


other inquiry).


**Improving our services:** We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them. In


general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a


specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).


**Customizing your experience:** We use your data to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering your


preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.


**Marketing and advertising:** We use your data to display ads and send you offers. We may also use your data in delivering third-


party advertisements to you. This may include "targeted ads" based upon your activities.


**Exercising our rights:** Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our


service. For example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.


**Legal compliance:** We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For example, we may need to gather your data to


respond to a subpoena or court order.

We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.


**5. With Whom We Share Your Data**


We share data with third parties as follows:


**As you instruct:** We may make your profile and videos available to others as you instruct in using our services. We may share your


data with persons to whom you have granted account-level access.


**With your consent:** We may share your data with third parties where we have obtained your express consent to do so. You may


revoke these consents.


**Authorized vendors:** We may share your data with third-party vendors that help us operate our services, process orders, and


comply with your instructions and our contractual obligations. This includes payment processors, content delivery networks (CDNs),


cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers, quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse


prevention vendors, customer relations management (CRM) vendors, and shipment vendors.


**Advertising:** We may share your data with advertising companies to display relevant ads to you. Unless you expressly agree, we will


not share or sell your name, email address, or physical address with such persons.


**Analytics:** We may share your data with persons who provide analytics showing how customers are using our services.


**Affiliates and advisors:** We may share your data with our parent company,</span> IAC<span style="background-color: red;"> fam</span><span style="background-color: green;">/InterAct</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ly </span><span style="background-color: green;">veC</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">rp, and our auditors and advisors </span>f<span style="background-color: green;">or</span>

connection with a corporate transaction as discussed in Section 6.


**Aggregated or anonymized information:** We may publicly disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as


our number of visitors and registered users.


We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security practices. We require that such vendors agree to protect the


data we share.


**6. Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures**


We may disclose your data in response to official request</span>s (<span style="background-color: green;">e</span><span style="background-color: red;">www</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">g</span><span style="background-color: red;">iac</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">, </span>co<span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">urt orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.</span>)<span style="background-color: red;">.</span>

legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.


</span>We <span style="background-color: green;">may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk. For example, if we become aware of a person


threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.


We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">oll</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ct About You**

does not identify you. When you provide personal information throu</span>g<span style="background-color: red;">h our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">United St</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">tes a</span>nd<span style="background-color: red;"> other countries around the world.


**Information you provide.** We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some


other manner, including personal information that may be contained in any video, comment or other submission you upload or post


to the website. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number; your


likeness; and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type,


expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and


age, and other demographic information.


**Information from other sources.** We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from


other IAC businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties.</span> Ex<span style="background-color: red;">am</span>pl<span style="background-color: red;">es </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">nforma</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ion that w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> may receive inclu</span>d<span style="background-color: green;"> Childr</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">n (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.


We may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users. If you submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act


(DMCA) or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user. If you challenge such a notice, we may share your


response with the complainant.


We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by


a third party. In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.


**7. Data Retention**


We retain your data for as long as you have an account. When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos. We may


retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you;


and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a business reason for retaining data,


we will delete or anonymize it.



We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion. Once we delete a video, we may not be


able to recover it. If you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for


a time. We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.


If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply


with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or


assert our rights.


**8. Your Privacy Choices**


We enable you to make numerous choices about your data</span>:

<span style="background-color: green;">of your choices.


</span>**<span style="background-color: green;">Profile**


Some of our online subscription plans enable you to "hide" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website. Your profile will,


however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.


**Team Members**


Some of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others. Persons with such access ("**Team Members**")


may be able to see and potentially alter your data. You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.


**Videos**


We enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos. Your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:


**Public (or "anyone"):** Your video will be publicly-available.


**Just you (i.e., "only me"):** Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.


**Selected people:** Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).


**Password-protected:** Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.


**Private link:** Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.


You may change these settings at any time. Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis. You should exercise caution in granting access


to others. Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those


persons may share the password and/or link with other people. Regardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the


right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.


**10. Communications from Us**

**How We Protect Your Personal Information**


We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal


information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal


information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive


personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your


personal information.


We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although


we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other


communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and


should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at


http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.


**User Submissions**


We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload


content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are


governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on


the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information


will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or share it with another user,


you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you


post or otherwise share with other users, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.


Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.

We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use


tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any


personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the


advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this


information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information


allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that

**Web Beacons:**


Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the


online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly


on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.


Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also


may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
