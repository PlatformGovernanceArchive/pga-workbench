<p><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities</p>
<p>on our website or while using our services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal information.</em></strong> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give</p>
<p>you an opportunity to <strong>opt out</strong> of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>
<p><strong>Authorized service providers:</strong> We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain</p>
<p>services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing</p>
<p>customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and</p>
<p>supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have access to</p>
<p>personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Business partners:</strong> To the extent any personal information is contained in any video, comment or other user submission, such</p>
<p>information When you make purchases, reservations or engage in promotions offered through our website or our services, we may</p>
<p>share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or</p>
<p>sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and</p>
<p>other information to that merchant.</p>
<p><strong>Direct mail partners.</strong> From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be</p>
<p>of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time by <strong>clicking here</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other IAC businesses.</strong> We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses). We may</p>
<p>share information we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies. Sharing information with our IAC companies</p>
<p>enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.</p>
<p><strong>Other Situations.</strong> We also may disclose your information:</p>
<p>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or</p>
<p>other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In</p>
<p>such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report or take other action regarding</p>
<p>illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users,</p>
<p>our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and</p>
<p>conditions or other agreements or policies.</p>
<p>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset</p>
<p>sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and</p>
<p>disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it</p>
<p>with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit</p>
<p>the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggregated and non-personal information.</em></strong> We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above</p>
<p>circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our</p>
<p>websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information</p>
<p>collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for</p>
<p>the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the</p>
<p>most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop</p>
<p>website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of places on our website or through our services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not</p>
<p>operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a</p>
<p>website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information,</p>
<p>from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the</p>
<p>privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are</p>
<p>visiting.</p>

<p>account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided</p>

<p>close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity,</p>
<p>as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity</p>
<p>of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to</p>
<p>third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website</p>
<p>because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a</p>
<p>contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</p>
<p>When you register on our website you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters</p>

<p>no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the following link and entering the email</p>
<p>address associated with your account: <strong>click here</strong>. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you,</p>
<p>to <strong>opt out</strong> of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you</p>
<p>other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and</p>
<p>surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that, changing information in your account, or</p>
<p>otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have</p>
<p>already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider) before you have</p>
<p>changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</p>
<p>You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by</p>
<p>clicking on the following link and entering the email address associated with your account: <strong>click here</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal</p>
<p>information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal</p>
<p>information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive</p>
<p>personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your</p>
<p>personal information.</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although</p>
<p>we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other</p>
<p>communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and</p>
<p>should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at</p>
<p><strong>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</strong> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>User Submissions</strong></p>
<p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload</p>
<p>content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are</p>
<p>governed by our <strong>Terms and Conditions of Use</strong>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed</p>
<p>on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that</p>
<p>information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive</p>
<p>unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so</p>
<p>we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may</p>
<p>not be able to edit or delete such information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on or via our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting</p>
<p>our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the</p>
<p>United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States</p>
<p>and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to</p>
<p>ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and</p>
<p>those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<p>the website.</p>

<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use,</p>
<p>and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your</p>
<p>account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our</p>
