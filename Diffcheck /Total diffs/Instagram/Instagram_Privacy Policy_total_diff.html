<p><h1>20110718102340_vs_20110818092924</h1></p><p>Burbn Inc. ("Burbn") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com,</p>
<p>and burbn.com. It is Burbn’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information</p>
<p>we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<p>Website Visitors</p>
<p>Like most website operators, Burbn collects non-personally-identifying information of</p>
<p>the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser</p>
<p>type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>
<p>Burbn’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better</p>
<p>understand how Burbn’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Burbn may</p>
<p>release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a</p>
<p>report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Burbn also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol</p>
<p>(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Instagram posts.</p>
<p>Burbn only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same</p>
<p>circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as</p>
<p>described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed</p>
<p>to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Certain visitors to Burbn’s websites choose to interact with Burbn in ways that require</p>
<p>Burbn to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information</p>
<p>that Burbn gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask</p>
<p>visitors who sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and</p>
<p>email address. In each case, Burbn collects such information only insofar as is</p>
<p>necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Burbn.</p>
<p>Burbn does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described</p>
<p>below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with</p>
<p>the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p>Aggregated Statistics</p>
<p>Burbn may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Burbn may</p>
<p>display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Burbn does not</p>
<p>disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Burbn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information</p>
<p>only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to</p>
<p>know that information in order to process it on Burbn’s behalf or to provide services</p>
<p>available at Burbn’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>
<p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located</p>
<p>outside of your home country; by using Burbn’s websites, you consent to the transfer</p>
<p>of such information to them. Burbn will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying</p>
<p>and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,</p>
<p>contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Burbn discloses</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when</p>
<p>required to do so by law, or when Burbn believes in good faith that disclosure is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Burbn, third parties or the</p>
<p>public at large. If you are a registered user of a Burbn website and have supplied your</p>
<p>email address, Burbn may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new</p>
<p>features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with</p>
<p>Burbn and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate</p>
<p>this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you</p>
<p>send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback</p>
<p>mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to</p>
<p>your request or to help us support other users. Burbn takes all measures reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and</p>
<p>that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Burbn</p>
<p>uses cookies to help Burbn identify and track visitors, their usage of Burbn website,</p>
<p>and their website access preferences. Burbn visitors who do not wish to have cookies</p>
<p>placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using</p>
<p>Burbn’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Burbn’s websites may not</p>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising</p>
<p>partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your</p>

<p>Instagram Inc. ("Instagram") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com, and Instagram.com. It is Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Website Visitors<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Like most website operators, Instagram collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>typically make<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>request. Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s purpose in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s visitors<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>use its website. From time to time, Instagram may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Instagram also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>users leaving<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>comments on Instagram posts. Instagram only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>same</span> <span style="background-color: red;">circum</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">t</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">nc</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s</span> <span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">that </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">t </span><span style="background-color: green;">rc</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">m</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;">es </span>an<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">ces</span> <span style="background-color: green;">that it uses and</p>
<p></span>discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Certain visitors to Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s websites choose to interact with Instagram in ways that require Instagram to gather personally-<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>identifying<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information. The amount and type of information that Instagram gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>example, we ask visitors who<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and email address. In each<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>case, Instagram collects such information only<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s interaction<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>with Instagram. Instagram does not disclose personally-<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>that it may prevent them from engaging in certain<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>website-related activities.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Aggregated Statistics<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Instagram may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Instagram may display this information publicly or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>provide it to others.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>However, Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Instagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>contractors</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">co</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d affilia</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span><span style="background-color: green;">ractors</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and affiliated</p>
<p></span>organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s behalf or to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>provide services available at Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>contractors and affiliated organizations may be located<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>outside of your home country; by using Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s websites, you consent<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>to the transfer of such information to them. Instagram will not rent or sell<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>organizations, as described above, Instagram<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to do so by law, or when<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instagram,<span style="background-color: red;"> third parties</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">third parties </span>or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Instagram website and have supplied your email address, Instagram may</p>
<p>occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s going<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>on</span> <span style="background-color: green;">on</span><span style="background-color: red;">with</span> <span style="background-color: green;">with</p>
<p></span>Instagram and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>expect to keep this type<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>other users. Instagram takes all measures reasonably<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help</p>
<p>you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,</p>
<p>changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii)</p>
<p>third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or</p>
<p>not someone associated with your contact is using Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party</p>
<p>service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then simply type a name to search and we will</p>
<p>perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Invite friends" feature, you may select</p>
<p>a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that</p>
<p>you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from</p>
<p>your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your</p>
<p>device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect</p>
<p>and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular</p>
<p>individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information</p>
<p>about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by</p>
<p>us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can</p>
<p>also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")</p>
<p>address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,</p>
<p>landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then</p>
<p>help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and</p>
<p>improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or</p>
<p>remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with</p>
<p>your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device</p>
<p>hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or</p>
<p>others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of</p>
<p>device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a</p>
<p>piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo),</p>
<p>geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and</p>
<p>more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the</p>
<p>photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or</p>
<p>activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag)</p>
<p>associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which Instagram is a part) without your</p>
<p>consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data (such as</p>
<p>usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.), with organizations that help us provide the Service to you</p>
<p>("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service</p>
<p>under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad</p>
<p>networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information</p>
<p>with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as</p>
<p>controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting.</p>
<p>Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under</p>
<p>our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if</p>
<p>other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied or saved that information</span>.</p>

<p>exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of</span> Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> in ways that require Instagram to gather personally-identifying</p>
<p>information. The amount and type of information that Instagram gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">we ask visit</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">rs who</p>
<p>sign </span>u<span style="background-color: red;">p fo</span>r <span style="background-color: green;">U</span><span style="background-color: red;">an account on http://in</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">tagram.com to provid</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> a use</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">name and email addre</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">s.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">In each case, Instagram c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">llects such info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mation</span> o<span style="background-color: red;">nly</p>

Instagram does not disclose personally-</p>
<p>identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat</p>
<p>that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORM</span>A<span style="background-color: green;">TION</span><span style="background-color: red;">ggregated Statistics</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">Instagram may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Instagram may display this information publicly or provide it to others.</p>
<p>However, Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Storage and </span>Pro<span style="background-color: red;">te</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">tion of C</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rtain Per</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">onally-Ident</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">fyi</span>ng<span style="background-color: green;">:</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which </span>Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">contr</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ctors and affiliated</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>Instagram may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or</p>
<p>jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal</p>
<p>information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Instagram, a</p>
<p>company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information</p>
<p>about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps</p>
<p>(such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot</p>
<p>ensure the security of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,</p>
<p>disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for</p>
<p>controlling access to emails between you and Instagram, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media</p>
<p>services you connect to Instagram make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any</p>
<p>other </span>organiz<span style="background-color: red;">ations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instagram's behalf or to provide services available at Instagram's</p>
<p>websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located</p>
<p>outside of your home country; by using Instagram's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Instagram will not rent or sell</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated</p>
<p>organizations, as described above, Instagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required</p>
<p>to do so by law, or when Instagram believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instagram,</p>
<p>third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Instagram website and have supplied your email address, Instagram may</p>
<p>occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with</p>
<p>Instagram and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type</p>
<p>of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to</p>
<p>publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Instagram takes all measures reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying</p>
<p>inform</span>ation.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Effective date: August 30, 2012.</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram<span style="background-color: red;">, Inc.</span> ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through our</p>
<p>content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software</p>
<p>provided on or in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and</p>
<p>other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use,</p>
<p>or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>

<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help</p>
<p>you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,</p>
<p>changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii)</p>
<p>third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or</p>
<p>not someone associated with your contact is using Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party</p>
<p>service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then simply type a name to search and we will</p>
<p>perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Invite friends" feature, you may select</p>
<p>a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that</p>
<p>you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from</p>
<p>your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your</p>
<p>device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect</p>
<p>and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular</p>
<p>individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information</p>
<p>about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by</p>
<p>us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can</p>
<p>also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")</p>
<p>address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,</p>
<p>landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then</p>
<p>help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and</p>
<p>improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or</p>
<p>remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with</p>
<p>your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device</p>
<p>hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or</p>
<p>others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of</p>
<p>device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a</p>
<p>piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo),</p>
<p>geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and</p>
<p>more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the</p>
<p>photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or</p>
<p>activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag)</p>
<p>associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which Instagram is a part) without your</p>
<p>consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data (such as</p>
<p>usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.), with organizations that help us provide the Service to you</p>
<p>("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service</p>
<p>under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad</p>
<p>networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information</p>
<p>with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as</p>
<p>controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting.</p>
<p>Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under</p>
<p>our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if</p>
<p>other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a</p>
<p>merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other</p>
<p>information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The</p>
<p>buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Instances where we may be required to share your information:</strong></p>
<p>Instagram will disclose your information where required to do so by law or by judicial process or if we reasonably believe that such action is</p>
<p>necessary to:</p>
<p>comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement</p>
<p>enforce our Terms of Use</p>
<p>protect the security or integrity of our Service</p>
<p>exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Instagram, our Users or others</p>
<p><strong>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Instagram, a</p>
<p>company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>Instagram may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or</p>
<p>jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal</p>
<p>information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Instagram, a</p>
<p>company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information</p>
<p>about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps</p>
<p>(such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot</p>
<p>ensure the security of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,</p>
<p>disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for</p>
<p>controlling access to emails between you and Instagram, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media</p>
<p>services you connect to Instagram make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any</p>
<p>other organization.</p>
<p><strong>5. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, please contact us directly at support@instagram.com.</p>
<p><strong>How long we keep your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, Instagram may retain information (including your profile information) and User</p>
<p>Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about termination or deactivation of your account, please contact us directly at support@instagram.com.</p>
<p><strong>6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>Instagram does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for</p>
<p>the Service. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal</p>
<p>information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might</p>
<p>have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@instagram.com.</p>
<p><strong>7. OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service, including the information or content</p>
<p>contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does</p>
<p>not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have</p>
<p>a link on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and do not have</p>
<p>control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them</p>
<p>to access your User Content you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Effective date: August 30,</span> 2012<span style="background-color: green;">, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> We knew that by teaming**</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating with</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being able to</strong></p>
<p><strong>share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you understand</strong></p>
<p><strong>that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your Instagram photos,</strong></p>
<p><strong>and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're looking forward to</strong></p>
<p><strong>working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core features of the app that</strong></p>
<p><strong>you've come to know and love.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected prior</strong></p>

<p><strong>© 2013 INSTAGRAM, INC.</strong></p><p><h1>20130617060242_vs_20130817010400</h1></p><p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users. </p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love. </p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li>
</ol>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center</p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</li>

<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li>
</ol>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Instagram </span>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</span></p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>

<p>other forms of marketing</p>

<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>

<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<ol>
<li>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</li>

<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>

<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>

<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>

<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>

<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>

<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>

<p><strong>© 201<span style="background-color: red;">3</span><span style="background-color: green;">4</span> INSTAGRAM, INC.</strong></p><p><h1>20141226110148_vs_20150102035655</h1></p><p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li>
</ol>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center</p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<ol>
<li>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<ol>
<li>HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or</p>
<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>
<p>including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries</p>
<p>or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer</p>
<p>information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same</p>
<p>data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>

<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>

<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>

<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>

<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>

<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>How can we help?</span></p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<p><strong>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or</p>

<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>
<p>including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries</p>
<p>or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer</p>
<p>information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same</p>
<p>data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to</p>
<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the</p>
<p>use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the</p>
<p>Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your</p>
<p>identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot ensure the security</p>
<p>of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be</p>
<p>accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique</p>
<p>password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Instagram,</p>
<p>at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and </span>protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or<span style="background-color: red;"> in</span></p>

<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>

<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>

<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>impaired</span> <span style="background-color: green;">impaired</p>
<p></span>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata<span style="background-color: red;"> can</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">can </span>describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content<span style="background-color: red;"> is</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">is </span>formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

<p><strong>© 2016 INSTAGRAM, INC.</strong></p><p><h1>20161231080636_vs_20170107080738</h1></p><p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p></span>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</span></p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>

<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>

<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>responsible<span style="background-color: green;"> for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</span></p>

<p>coming directly from your personal account, </span>Instagram does not have access to or<span style="background-color: red;"> control this</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">control this </span>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</p>
<p></span>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</span></p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or</p>
<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>
<p>including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries</p>
<p>or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer</p>
<p>information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same</p>
<p>data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to</p>
<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the</p>
<p>use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>

<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>

<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</span></p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>

<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>

<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>

<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p><strong></span>Privacy Policy<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>being<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>understand</span> <span style="background-color: red;">that yo</span>u<span style="background-color: red;"> still have co</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">trol ov</span>er<span style="background-color: red;"> who </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">ees</span><span style="background-color: green;">tand</span> <span style="background-color: red;">your</span><span style="background-color: green;">that</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you still have control over who sees your</p>
<p></span>photos. You still get to choose who can see your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>location to a photo), comments or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>being<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you<span style="background-color: red;"> understand that you still have control over who sees your</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">understand that you still have control over who sees your </span>photos. You still get to choose who can see your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</p>
<p></span>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</span></p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>

<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>
<p>including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries</p>

<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer</p>
<p>information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same</p>
<p>data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the</p>
<p>use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your</p>
<p>identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot ensure the security</p>
<p>of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be</p>
<p>accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

<p>password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Instagram,</p>
<p>at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you</p>

<p>security measures of any other organization.</p>

<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<p><strong>4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storage and Processing:</strong></p>
<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or</p>

<p>Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,</p>
<p>including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries</p>
<p>or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws</p>
<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer</p>
<p>information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same</p>
<p>data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to</p>
<p>any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the</p>
<p>use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the</p>
<p>Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your</p>
<p>identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot ensure the security</p>
<p>of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be</p>
<p>accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

<p>password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Instagram,</p>
<p>at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>

<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>

<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>

<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be</p>
<p>accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>

<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>

<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>

<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>

<p>Data Policy</p>
<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook,</span></p>
<p>In<span style="background-color: green;">stagram, Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook</p>
<p>(Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and</p>
<p>information in the Facebook</span> Se<span style="background-color: red;">p</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">embe</span><span style="background-color: green;">tings and Instag</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">am Settings.</p>
<p>I. What kinds of information do we</p>
<p>collect?</p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content,</p>
<p>and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or</p>
<p>about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo</p>
<p>or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through</p>
<p>features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest</p>
<p>masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera</p>
<p>formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you</p>
<p>and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes</p>
<p>described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the</p>
<p>things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in</p>
<p>your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your religious views,</p>
<p>political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other</p>
<p>information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade</p>
<p>union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws</p>
<p>of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you</p>
<p>interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with</p>
<p>the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you</p>
<p>choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book</p>
<p>or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and</p>
<p>others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such</p>
<p>as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time,</p>
<p>frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're</p>
<p>using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other</p>
<p>content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you</p>
<p>use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our</p>
<p>Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you</p>
<p>make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information</p>
<p>about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such</p>
<p>as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account</p>
<p>and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a</p>
<p>message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device. </p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes: </p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and</p>
<p>software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space,</p>
<p>browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed</p>
<p>on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded,</p>
<p>or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from</p>
<p>games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers</p>
<p>unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the same device or</p>
<p>account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or</p>
<p>photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile</p>
<p>operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address,</p>
<p>connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that</p>
<p>are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a</p>
<p>video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs</p>
<p>and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. </p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from. </p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p>II. How do we use this information?</p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices</p>
<p>to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that</p>
<p>you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience</p>
<p>more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration</p>
<p>information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when</p>
<p>you sign up for an account on a different Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as</p>
<p>your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the</p>
<p>businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can</p>
<p>be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect</p>
<p>it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook</p>
<p>Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to</p>
<p>develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The</p>
<p>face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use</p>
<p>face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook</p>
<p>Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram</p>
<p>experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether</p>
<p>we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about</p>
<p>you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show</p>
<p>you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices</p>
<p>over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>
<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p>III. How is this information shared?</p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>IV. How do the Facebook Companies</p>
<p>work together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p>V. How can I manage information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>VI. How do we respond to legal</p>
<p>requests or prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal</p>
<p>requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,</p>
<p>unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or</p>
<p>illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or</p>
<p>others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive</p>
<p>information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud,</p>
<p>abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p>VII. How do we operate and transfer</p>

<p>Date of Last Revision: April 19,</span> 201<span style="background-color: red;">2, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this</p>
<p>invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or</p>
<p>control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>

<p>connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that</p>
<p>are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a</p>
<p>video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs</p>
<p>and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>

<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. </p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from. </p>

<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide<span style="background-color: green;"> where you have given your explicit consent</span>);<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>about</span> <span style="background-color: red;">how we choose the </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ds</span><span style="background-color: green;">bout</span> <span style="background-color: green;">how we choose the ads</p>
<p></span>that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices</p>
<p>to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that</p>
<p>you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience</p>
<p>more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration</p>
<p>information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when</p>
<p>you sign up for an account on a different Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as</p>
<p>your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the</p>
<p>businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can</p>
<p>be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect</p>
<p>it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook</p>
<p>Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to</p>
<p>develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The</p>
<p>face-recognition templates we create <span style="background-color: red;">m</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">y constitute data with special</p>

<p></span>we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about</p>
<p>you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show</p>
<p>you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices</p>
<p>over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>
<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p>III. How is this information shared?</p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>IV. How do the Facebook Companies</p>
<p>work together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p>V. <span style="background-color: green;">Wh</span><span style="background-color: red;">How c</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">t is our legal basis for</p>
<p>processi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g data?</p>
<p>We collect, use and share the data that we have in the ways described above: </p>

<p>to protect your vital interests, or those of others;</p>
<p>as necessary in the public interest; and</p>
<p>as necessary for our (or others') legitimate interests, including our interests in</p>
<p>providing an innovative, personalized, safe, and profitable service to our</p>
<p>users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or</p>
<p>fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal</span> data.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>face-recognition templates we create are data with special protections under</p>
<p>EU law. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control</p>
<p>our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-</p>
<p>recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first,</p>
<p>and you will have control over whether </span>we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about</p>
<p>you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show</p>

<p>over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the</p>

<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>

<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>

<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p>III. How is this information shared?</p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>IV. How do the Facebook Companies</p>
<p>work together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>

<p>as necessary to comply with our legal obligations</p>
<p>to protect your vital interests, or those of others;</p>
<p>as necessary in the public interest; and</p>
<p>as necessary for our (or others') legitimate interests, including our interests in</p>
<p>providing an innovative, personalized, safe, and profitable service to our</p>
<p>users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or</p>
<p>fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.</p>

<p>VI. How <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">can y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;"> we respond to legal</p>
<p>req</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">ests or prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal</p>
<p>requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,</p>
<p>unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or</p>
<p>illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or</p>

<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>

<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device. </p>

<p>operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address,</p>

<p>video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs</p>
<p>and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>

<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. </p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from. </p>

<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices</p>
<p>to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that</p>
<p>you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience</p>
<p>more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration</p>
<p>information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when</p>
<p>you sign up for an account on a different Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as</p>
<p>your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the</p>
<p>businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can</p>
<p>be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect</p>
<p>it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook</p>
<p>Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to</p>
<p>develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The</p>
<p>face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use</p>
<p>face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook</p>
<p>Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram</p>
<p>experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether</p>
<p>we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about</p>
<p>you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show</p>
<p>you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices</p>
<p>over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>

<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>IV. How do the Facebook Companies</p>
<p>work together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p>V. How can I manage information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>VI. How do we respond to legal</p>
<p>requests or prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal</p>
<p>requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,</p>
<p>unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or</p>
<p>illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or</p>
<p>others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive</p>
<p>information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud,</p>
<p>abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p>VII. How do we operate and transfer</p>
<p>data as part of our global services?</p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p>VIII. How will we notify you of changes</p>
<p>to this policy?</p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<p>questions</p>

<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you too</span>k<span style="background-color: red;">e</span> <span style="background-color: red;">our c</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">n </span><span style="background-color: red;">mer</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ction in response to an ad</p>

<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>
<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p></span>III. How is this information shared?<span style="background-color: green;">**</span></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">**</span>IV. How do the Facebook Companies<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>work together?<span style="background-color: green;">**</span></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">**</span>V. How can I manage information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>about me?<span style="background-color: green;">**</span></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">**</span>VI. How do we respond to legal<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>requests or prevent harm?<span style="background-color: green;">**</span></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>have<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include<span style="background-color: red;"> responding to legal</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">responding to legal </span>requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>have a good-faith belief<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>affects users in that jurisdiction,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and is consistent with internationally recognized<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address<span style="background-color: red;"> fraud,</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">fraud, </span>unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other<span style="background-color: red;"> harmful or</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">harmful or </span>illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Products), you or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to prevent death or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information to and receive<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information from third-party partners about the reliability of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your account to prevent fraud,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>abuse and other harmful activity on and off our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">**</span>VII. How do we operate and transfer<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>data</span> <span style="background-color: green;">d</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">s par</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">a</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of</span><span style="background-color: green;">as</span> <span style="background-color: red;">ou</span><span style="background-color: green;">pa</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">t</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of our**</p>

<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">**</span>VIII. How will we notify you of changes<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>

<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>

<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>

<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>

<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>

<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>
<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>
<p>TrustArc. You can contact TrustArc through its website.</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide<span style="background-color: green;">.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>

<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>

<p><strong>Information from partners<span style="background-color: green;">.</span></strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>

<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests<span style="background-color: green;">.</span></strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manag<span style="background-color: green;">e or delet</span>e information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>

<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e</span></strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span></strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>
<p>TrustArc. You can contact TrustArc through its website.</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e</span></strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span></strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after <span style="background-color: green;">rev</span><span style="background-color: red;">subm</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ssio</span><span style="background-color: green;">ew, u</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">less otherwise stated</span>. Learn more about deletion of content you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>have shared and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>

<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>

<p>or photos.</p>

<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>

<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>

<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>

<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>

<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>

<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>

<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>

<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>

<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>

<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>

<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>

<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>

<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>

<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>

<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>

<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Permalink Related articles</p>
<p>Was this information helpful?</span></p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<p><strong>Data Policy</span></strong></p>
<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or</p>
<p>Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share</p>
<p>content, and message or communicate with others. This can include</p>
<p>information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as</p>
<p>the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include</p>
<p>what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we</p>
<p>can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give</p>
<p>you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process</p>
<p>content and communications you and others provide to analyze context</p>
<p>and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about</p>
<p>how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide</p>
<p>information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your</p>
<p>religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your</p>
<p>health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,</p>
<p>philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject</p>
<p>to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how</p>
<p>you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect</p>
<p>contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a</p>
<p>device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which</p>
<p>we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know</p>
<p>and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products,</p>
<p>such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you</p>
<p>use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and</p>
<p>the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log</p>
<p>when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts,</p>
<p>videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect</p>
<p>information about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use</p>
<p>our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when</p>
<p>you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment</p>
<p>information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information; other account and authentication information; and billing,</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you,</p>
<p>send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans</p>
<p>from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera</p>
<p>or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your</p>
<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help</p>
<p>you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie</p>
<p>IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and</p>
<p>devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we</p>
<p>can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically</p>
<p>filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from</p>
<p>one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-</p>
<p>such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go,</p>
<p>and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related</p>
<p>information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've</p>
<p>allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you</p>
<p>attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting</p>
<p>surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.</p>
<p>The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with</p>
<p>special protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how</p>
<p>we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology</p>
<p>in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control</p>
<p>over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have</p>
<p>about you-including information about your interests, actions and</p>
<p>connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and</p>
<p>personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and</p>
<p>other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business</strong></p>
<p><strong>services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we</p>
<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration</p>
<p>patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you</p>
<p>have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we</p>
<p>have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or</p>
<p>to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Permalink Related articles</p>
<p>Was this information helpful?</p>
<p></span>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of</p>
<p>your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>Permalink Related articles</p>
<p>Was this information helpful?</span></p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our</strong></p>
<p><strong>global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<p>Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This</p>
<p>and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership)</p>

<p>personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as</p>

<p>a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from</p>
<p>bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you</p>
<p>use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>

<p>how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>

<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through Facebook Business Tools they use,</p>
<p>including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook</p>

<p>device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not</p>
<p>you have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to</p>
<p>tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive</p>
<p>information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights</p>
<p>to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require</p>
<p>each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>

<p>Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>

<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized</p>
<p>Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based</p>

<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on</p>
<p>Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information</p>
<p>(such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as your current location, where</p>
<p>you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things</p>
<p>like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>

<p>videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or</p>
<p>control our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether we use this technology</p>
<p>for you.</p>

<p>your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content</p>
<p>that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we</p>
<p>use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you</p>
<p>see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and</p>
<p>services. Learn how we share information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam</p>
<p>and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>or policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and</p>
<p>Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our</p>
<p>Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you</p>
<p>contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support</p>
<p>research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief</p>
<p>efforts. Learn more about our research programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example,</p>
<p>when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or</p>
<p>a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or</p>
<p>businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you</p>
<p>have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts</p>
<p>see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This</p>
<p>includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public</p>
<p>profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public</p>
<p>forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide</p>
<p>access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or</p>
<p>downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by</p>
<p>apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can</p>
<p>choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can</p>
<p>download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their</p>
<p>content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can</p>
<p>change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For</p>
<p>example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you</p>
<p>on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you</p>
<p>are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products,</p>
<p>they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can</p>
<p>receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website</p>
<p>on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on</p>
<p>Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of</p>
<p>Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers</p>
<p>(although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information</p>
<p>collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not</p>
<p>developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For</em></p>
<p><em>example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</em></p>
<p><em>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can</em></p>
<p><em>request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to</p>
<p>the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business</p>
<p>Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we</p>
<p>share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are</p>
<p>engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or</p>
<p>accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other</p>
<p>information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing,</p>
<p>but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a</p>
<p>woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action</p>
<p>with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to</p>
<p>our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content</p>
<p>creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by</p>
<p>providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances</p>
<p>scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics</p>
<p>of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in</p>
<p>the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted</p>
<p>by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp</p>
<p>about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such</p>
<p>as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted -</p>
<p>whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is</p>
<p>collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on</p>
<p>Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is</p>
<p>deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that</p>
<p>copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data</p>
<p>obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be</p>
<p>able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be</p>
<p>deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your</p>
<p>account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is</p>
<p>consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the</p>
<p>Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be</p>
<p>accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental</p>
<p>investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those</p>
<p>you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred</p>
<p>or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as</p>
<p>described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and</p>
<p>Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the</p>
<p>European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data</p>
<p>transfers to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you</p>
<p>choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have questions about this policy, you can</p>

<p><strong>Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and other products and</p>
<p>features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and information in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect depend on</p>
<p>how you use our Products. You can learn how to access and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings</p>
<p>and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content, communications and other information you</p>
<p>provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and</p>
<p>message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like</p>
<p>metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see</p>
<p>through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest masks and filters that you</p>
<p>might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and</p>
<p>communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described</p>
<p>below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Facebook profile fields or</p>
<p>Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This</p>
<p>and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership)</p>
<p>could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and</p>
<p>groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to</p>
<p>upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we</p>
<p>use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view</p>
<p>or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the</p>
<p>time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our</p>
<p>Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information</p>
<p>about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our Products for purchases or other</p>
<p>financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit</p>
<p>card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping</p>
<p>and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also receive and analyze content,</p>
<p>communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include</p>
<p>information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you, or</p>
<p>upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-</p>
<p>connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better</p>
<p>personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as</p>
<p>your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone</p>
<p>on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level,</p>
<p>signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as whether</p>
<p>a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from</p>
<p>bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you</p>
<p>use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell</p>
<p>towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as</p>
<p>access to your GPS location, camera or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time</p>
<p>zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone</p>
<p>to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about</p>
<p>how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through Facebook Business Tools they use,</p>
<p>including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook</p>
<p>pixel. These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—including information about your</p>
<p>device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not</p>
<p>you have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to</p>
<p>tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive</p>
<p>information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights</p>
<p>to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require</p>
<p>each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>
<p>Learn more about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook Business Tools, review the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Facebook</p>
<p>Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including</p>
<p>your News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized</p>
<p>Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based</p>
<p>on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to</p>
<p>provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and</p>
<p>interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to personalize your</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram experience, including features, content and recommendations in Facebook Products;</p>
<p>you can also learn more about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on</p>
<p>different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on</p>
<p>Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information</p>
<p>(such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as your current location, where</p>
<p>you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things</p>
<p>like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos,</p>
<p>videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or</p>
<p>control our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether we use this technology</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information about</p>
<p>your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content</p>
<p>that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we</p>
<p>use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you</p>
<p>see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and</p>
<p>services. Learn how we share information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam</p>
<p>and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>or policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and</p>
<p>Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our</p>
<p>Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you</p>
<p>contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support</p>
<p>research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief</p>
<p>efforts. Learn more about our research programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example,</p>
<p>when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or</p>
<p>a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or</p>
<p>businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you</p>
<p>have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts</p>
<p>see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This</p>
<p>includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public</p>
<p>profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public</p>
<p>forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide</p>
<p>access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or</p>
<p>downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by</p>
<p>apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can</p>
<p>choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can</p>
<p>download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their</p>
<p>content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can</p>
<p>change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For</p>
<p>example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you</p>
<p>on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you</p>
<p>are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products,</p>
<p>they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can</p>
<p>receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website</p>
<p>on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on</p>
<p>Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of</p>
<p>Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers</p>
<p>(although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information</p>
<p>collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not</p>
<p>developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For</em></p>
<p><em>example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</em></p>
<p><em>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can</em></p>
<p><em>request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to</p>
<p>the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business</p>
<p>Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we</p>
<p>share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are</p>
<p>engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or</p>
<p>accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other</p>
<p>information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing,</p>
<p>but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a</p>
<p>woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action</p>
<p>with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to</p>
<p>our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content</p>
<p>creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by</p>
<p>providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances</p>
<p>scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics</p>
<p>of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in</p>
<p>the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted</p>
<p>by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp</p>
<p>about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such</p>
<p>as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted -</p>
<p>whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is</p>
<p>collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on</p>
<p>Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is</p>
<p>deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that</p>
<p>copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data</p>
<p>obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be</p>
<p>able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be</p>
<p>deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your</p>
<p>account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is</p>
<p>consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the</p>
<p>Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be</p>
<p>accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental</p>
<p>investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those</p>
<p>you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred</p>
<p>or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as</p>
<p>described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and</p>
<p>Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the</p>
<p>European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data</p>
<p>transfers to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you</p>
<p>choose to continue using our Products.</p>
