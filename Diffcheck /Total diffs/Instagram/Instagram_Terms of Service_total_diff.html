</ol>
<p>Terms of Use or any other Instagram terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your Instagram account. You understand and</li>
</ol>
<p>agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If</p>
<p>you violate the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we can stop</p>
<p>providing all or part of the Service to you.</p>
<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and</li>
</ol>
<p>without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate</p>
<p>your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will</p>
<p>not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service</p>
<p>(e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to time. Unless we make a</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You</p>
<p>agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date</p>
<p>of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as</p>
<p>of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point</p>
<p>forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Instagram is not</li>
</ol>
<p>responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in</p>
<p>disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you</p>
<p>submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may</li>
</ol>
<p>also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that</p>
<p>we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web</p>
<p>site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For</p>
<p>example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which</p>
<p>may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on</p>
<p>the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their</p>
<p>content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or</p>
<p>features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE</p>
<p>SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk,</p>
<p>to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such</p>
<p>Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your</p>
<p>profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed</p>
<p>and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own</p>
<p>option and risk, and you will hold the Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with</p>
<p>Instagram's express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>

<p>Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3</p>

<p>Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode</p>
<p>and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p></span>You <span style="background-color: green;">ack</span><span style="background-color: red;">must </span>no<span style="background-color: red;">t use </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">dge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</p>

<p>post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright,</li>
</ol>
<p>trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram</p>
<p>Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices</p>
<p>incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,</p>
<p>perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior</li>

<p>written permission of Instagram, except in accordance with our brand guidelines, available here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be</li>
</ol>
<p>interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of</p>
<p>telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,</p>
<p>without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to</p>
<p>comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to</p>
<p>maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the</p>
<p>Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or</p>
<p>discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security</p>
<p>and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Instagram does not have any</li>
</ol>
<p>obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal</p>
<p>responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and</li>
</ol>

<p>Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality,</p>
<p>property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by</p>
<p>you</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,</p>
<p>trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above</p>
<p>("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to</p>
<p>your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of</p>
<p>privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of</p>
<p>consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local</p>
<p>"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Instagram will</p>
<p>participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought</p>
<p>in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the</p>
<p>proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is</p>
<p>unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have</p>
<p>the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be</p>
<p>entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award</p>
<p>damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration</p>
<p>proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.</p>
<p>You must use this address to opt out:</p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025</p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you want to</p>
<p>opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of</p>
<p>the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship</p>
<p>with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such claim</p>
<p>arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of</p>
<p>conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS</p>
<p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the</p>
<p>arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute</p>
<p>you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent</p>
<p>jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any</p>
<p>remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a</p>
<p>waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any</p>
<p>other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes</p>
<p>arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions</p>
<p>with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior</p>
<p>agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole</p>
<p>or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported assignment or delegation by</p>
<p>you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights</p>
<p>hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise</p>
<p>unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity</p>
<p>and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course</p>
<p>of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party</p>
<p>beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where</p>
<p>such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such</p>
<p>jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or</p>
<p>jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that</p>
<p>Instagram provides.</p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be</p>
<p>downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or</p>
<p>(b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny</p>
<p>Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a</p>
<p>national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to time. Unless we make a</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">date </span>of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Terms.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>effective as<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service<span style="background-color: red;"> from that point</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">from that point </span>forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

</ol>
<p>also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content<span style="background-color: red;"> that</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">that </span>we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>party, which<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>profile on the Service being<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Instagram is not</li>
</ol>
<p>responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in</p>

<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may</li>
</ol>
<p>also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that</p>
<p>we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web</p>
<p>site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For</p>
<p>example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which</p>
<p>may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on</p>
<p>the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their</p>
<p>content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or</p>
<p>features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE</p>
<p>SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk,</p>
<p>to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such</p>
<p>Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your</p>
<p>profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed</p>
<p>and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own</p>
<p>option and risk, and you will hold the Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-</li>
</ol>
<p>exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3</p>
<p>("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p>who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode</p>
<p>and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate,</p>
<p>misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark</p>
<p>and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you</p>
<p>post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright,</li>
</ol>
<p>trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram</p>
<p>Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices</p>
<p>incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,</p>
<p>perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior</li>

<p>service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior</p>
<p>written permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be</li>
</ol>
<p>interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of</p>
<p>telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,</p>
<p>without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to</p>
<p>comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to</p>
<p>maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the</p>
<p>Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or</p>
<p>discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security</p>
<p>and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Instagram does not have any</li>
</ol>
<p>obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal</p>
<p>responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that</p>
<p>your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the</p>
<p>general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of</p>
<p>Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have</li>
</ol>
<p>specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if</p>
<p>your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not accept unsolicited</p>
<p>materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us</p>
<p>content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and</p>
<p>services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH</p>

<p>KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM</p>
<p>MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND</p>
<p>YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES,</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY</p>
<p>SUCH THIRD PARTIES.<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Instagram's request), indemnify and</p>
<p>hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable</p>
<p>attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the</p>
<p>Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality,</p>
<p>property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by</p>
<p>you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense</p>
<p>and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,</p>
<p>trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above</p>
<p>("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to</p>
<p>your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of</p>
<p>privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of</p>
<p>consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local</p>
<p>"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Instagram will</p>
<p>participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought</p>
<p>in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the</p>
<p>proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is</p>
<p>unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have</p>
<p>the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be</p>
<p>entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award</p>
<p>damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration</p>
<p>proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.</p>
<p>You must use this address to opt out:</p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025</p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you want to</p>
<p>opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of</p>
<p>the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship</p>
<p>with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such claim</p>
<p>arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of</p>
<p>conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS</p>
<p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the</p>
<p>arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute</p>
<p>you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent</p>
<p>jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any</p>
<p>remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a</p>
<p>waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any</p>
<p>other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions</p>
<p>with Instagram.<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior</p>
<p>agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole</p>
<p>or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported assignment or delegation by</p>
<p>you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights</p>
<p>hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise</p>
<p>unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity</p>
<p>and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course</p>
<p>of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party</p>
<p>beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where</p>
<p>such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such</p>
<p>jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or</p>
<p>jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that</p>
<p>Instagram provides.</p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be</p>
<p>downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or</p>
<p>(b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny</p>
<p>Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a</p>
<p>national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>
<p>The effective date of these Terms of Use is January 19, 2013. These Terms of Use were written in English (US). To the extent any translated</p>
<p>version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>

<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p>Rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here:</p>
<p>https://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/182487. In addition, all page headers, custom</p>
<p>graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram,</p>
<p>and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>

<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p>Time Limitation on Claims</p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Governing Law &amp; Venue</p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>Territorial Restrictions</p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

</ol>
<p>Instagram account. You understand and agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for</p>
<p>the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter</p>
<p>or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we</p>

<p>General Conditions</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you</p>
<p>use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships,</p>
<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p>Rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here:</p>
<p>https://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/182487. In addition, all page headers, custom</p>
<p>graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram,</p>
<p>and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING,</p>
<p>WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION</p>
<p>OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR</p>

<p>TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OR ACTION EXCEED ONE HUNDRED UNITED</p>
<p>STATES DOLLARS ($100.00). </p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT</p>
<p>OF INSTAGRAM'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT</p>
<p>IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION</p>
<p>OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED</p>
<p>BY THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY</p>
<p>WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE</p>
<p>INSTAGRAM PARTIES. </p>
<p>BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH</p>
<p>RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE</p>
<p>WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY</p>
<p>EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY</p>
<p>SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL</p>
<p>RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO</p>
<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST</p>
<p>HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." </p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p>Indemnification</p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>
<p>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p>Time Limitation on Claims</p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Governing Law &amp; Venue</p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>Territorial Restrictions</p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>

</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p>Rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>

<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>

<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p>Indemnification</p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>
<p>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p>Time Limitation on Claims</p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Governing Law &amp; Venue</p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>Territorial Restrictions</p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p>Rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p>Indemnification</p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>
<p>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p>Time Limitation on Claims</p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Governing Law &amp; Venue</p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>Territorial Restrictions</p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<ol>
<li>Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram account. You understand and agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for</p>
<p>the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>General Conditions<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you</p>
<p>use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships,</p>
<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>

</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>

<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>

<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>

<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OF GOD, TELECOMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>FAILURE, OR THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SERVICE). IN NO EVENT WILL THE INSTAGRAM</p>
<p>PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING,</p>
<p>WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION</p>
<p>OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR</p>
<p>EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES TOTAL LIABILITY</p>
<p>TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OR ACTION EXCEED ONE HUNDRED UNITED</p>
<p>STATES DOLLARS ($100.00). </p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT</p>
<p>OF INSTAGRAM'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT</p>
<p>IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION</p>
<p>OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED</p>
<p>BY THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY</p>
<p>WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE</p>
<p>INSTAGRAM PARTIES. </p>
<p>BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH</p>
<p>RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE</p>
<p>WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY</p>
<p>EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY</p>
<p>SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL</p>
<p>RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO</p>
<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST</p>
<p>HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." </p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>
<p>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>

<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>

<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>

<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>

</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>

<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>

<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>

<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>

<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>

<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>

<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>

<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>

<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>

<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>

<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>

<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>

<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>

<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<ol>
<li>Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your</li>

<p>the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>General Conditions<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you</p>
<p>use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships,</p>
<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>

</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>

<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>

<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>

<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>General Conditions<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>

<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you</p>
<p>use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships,</p>
<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>

<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>

<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>

<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>

</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>

<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>

<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>

<p>BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH</p>
<p>RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE</p>
<p>WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY</p>
<p>EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY</p>
<p>SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL</p>
<p>RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO</p>
<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST</p>
<p>HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." </p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED</p>
<p>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Indemnification<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or</p>
<p>(v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any</p>
<p>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>

<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will<span style="background-color: red;"> immediately</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">immediately </span>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>

<p></span>WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Indemnification<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">any </span>claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Territorial Restrictions<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>

<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>

<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>

<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>

<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>

<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Indemnification<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>

<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>

<p></span>AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>provision will be deemed severable from these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>This dispute resolution provision will survive the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Use constitute the entire agreement between you and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>null and void.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>these Terms of Use is found by a court of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and will not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>
<p>likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users</p>
<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>

</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p>Rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST</p>
<p>HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." </p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY</p>
<p>CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p>Indemnification</p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p>Time Limitation on Claims</p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Governing Law &amp; Venue</p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>Territorial Restrictions</p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to</p>

<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>

<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>

<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>

<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>

<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>

<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>

<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>

<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>

<p>CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Indemnification<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>General Conditions<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to</p>
<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>
<p>likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users</p>
<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>

<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>

<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Indemnification<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>

<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Territorial Restrictions<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>

</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to</p>
<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>

<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>

<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>

<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>

<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>

</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>

<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>

<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>

<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Arbitration<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>

<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>

<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>
<p>likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users</p>
<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL</p>

<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST</p>
<p>HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." </p>
<p>INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM</p>
<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY</p>
<p>CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>

<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>

<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>

<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>

<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>

<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY</p>
<p>CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>

<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>

<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>

<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY</p>
<p>CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at</p>
<p>Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,</p>
<p>liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,</p>
<p>arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on</p>
<p>the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)</p>
<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of</p>
<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>

<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury</p>
<p>Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.</p>
<p>By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,</p>
<p>under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. </p>
<p>The effective date of these Terms of Use is January 19, 2013. These Terms of Use were written in English (US).</p>
<p>To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English</p>
<p>version controls.</p>

<p>Instagram account. You understand and agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for</p>
<p>the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter</p>
<p>or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we</p>
<p>can stop providing all or part of the Service to you.</p>
<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to</p>
<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>
<p>likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users</p>
<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features.</span> YOU<span style="background-color: red;">R</span> C<span style="background-color: red;">ORRESPONDENCE </span>AN<span style="background-color: red;">D</span> <span style="background-color: green;">OP</span><span style="background-color: red;">BUSINESS DEALINGS WI</span>T<span style="background-color: red;">H</span> <span style="background-color: red;">THIRD</p>

<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>

<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>
<p>posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or</p>
<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>The</span> I<span style="background-color: green;">nstagram Service</p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>
<p>deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your</p>
<p>information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information</p>
<p>about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law</p>
<p>enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,</p>
<p>safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>

<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>

<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>

<p>reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these</p>
<p>Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any</p>
<p>matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim</p>
<p>without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>
<p>Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized</p>
<p>ways (for example, automated ways</span>). <span style="background-color: green;">In addition, issues relating to the scope and</p>
<p>enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. </span></p>
<p>Y<span style="background-color: red;">OU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT</p>
<p>OF INSTAGRAM'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT</p>
<p>IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION</p>
<p>OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED</p>
<p>BY THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE</p>

<p>your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without</p>

<p>any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;</p>
<p>or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to</p>
<p>indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as</p>
<p>trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API</p>
<p>Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that</p>
<p>all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the</p>
<p>Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram</p>
<p>hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>

<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.</p>
<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in</p>
<p>any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would</p>
<p>subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
<p>other feature that Instagram provides. </p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no</p>
<p>software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)</p>
<p>any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone o</span>n the U.S. <span style="background-color: green;">District Court for the Northern District of California or a</p>

<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>

<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>

<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,</p>
<p>safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings<span style="background-color: red;">. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>Your Commitments</p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us. </p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. </p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under</p>
<p>applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an</p>
<p>applicable denied party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of</p>
<p>our policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>

<p>Our Agreement and What Happens if</p>
<p>We Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of</p>
<p>our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related</p>
<p>services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will</p>
<p>also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will</p>
<p>be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with</p>
<p>this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail</p>
<p>to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our</p>
<p>ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>

<p>Updating These Terms</p>

<p></span>b<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">le</span> <span style="background-color: red;">impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsib</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">aw, w</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> will notify you</span> (<span style="background-color: green;">for </span><span style="background-color: red;">"liabl</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">"</span><span style="background-color: green;">xample, through our Service</span>)<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or</p>
<p>account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed</p>
<p>the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against</p>
<p>any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,</p>
<p>reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these</p>
<p>Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any</p>
<p>matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim</p>
<p>without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>
<p>Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized</p>
<p>ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and</p>
<p>enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. </p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within</span> 30 days <span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">of th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;"> date that y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u ag</span>re<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">to th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">se</span></p>

<p>with your Instagram account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a</p>
<p>dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may</p>
<p>commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees</p>
<p>for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely</p>
<p>provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including</p>
<p>rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will</p>
<p>be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a</p>
<p>state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal</p>
<p>jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p>The Instagram Service</p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span>they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>
<p>deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your</p>
<p>information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information</p>
<p>about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,</p>
<p>safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings<span style="background-color: green;">. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>Your Commitments</p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us. </p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>

<p>our policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>

<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>

<p><strong>or unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>

<p>intellectual property rights, here.</p>

<p>that we need to provide the Service. </p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license</strong></p>
<p><strong>to use it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim</p>
<p>ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when</p>
<p>you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights</p>
<p>(like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to</p>
<p>us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license</p>
<p>to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate,</p>
<p>and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and</p>
<p>application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content</p>
<p>or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others</p>
<p>and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and</p>
<p>how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the</p>
<p>Instagram Help Center.</p>

<p><strong>your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored</strong></p>
<p><strong>content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information</p>
<p>about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in</p>
<p>connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you</p>
<p>follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any</p>
<p>compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored</p>
<p>post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with</p>
<p>actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored</p>
<p>content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who</p>
<p>have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad</p>
<p>settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on</strong></p>
<p><strong>your device.</strong></p>
<p>Additional Rights We Retain</p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it</p>
<p>if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes</p>
<p>someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we</p>
<p>provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our</p>
<p>content (but not yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>

<p>Our Agreement and What Happens if</p>
<p>We Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of</p>
<p>our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related</p>
<p>services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will</p>
<p>also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will</p>
<p>be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with</p>
<p>this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail</p>

<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or</span> In<span style="background-color: red;"> all</p>
<p>other ca</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">es, you agree </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">gr</span><span style="background-color: red;">t the cl</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">i</span>m<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>("claim(s)")</span> must be resolved <span style="background-color: red;">in</span><span style="background-color: green;">by</span> a<span style="background-color: red;"> competent cou</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">t </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">n </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">he</span><span style="background-color: green;">ration on an individual basis. Class actions and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration </span>R<span style="background-color: red;">ep</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">b</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ic</span><span style="background-color: green;">es.</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The </span>f<span style="background-color: green;">ollowing claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our Terms of Use are changing. You can view our previous Terms of</p>
<p>Use here.</p>
<p>Terms of Use</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information</p>
<p>about the Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram</p>
<p>account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement</p>
<p>between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram Service</p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>
<p>deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your</p>
<p>information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information</p>
<p>about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law</p>
<p>enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)<span style="background-color: red;">-</span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>in order to provide services that are better,<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>safer,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">safer,</p>
<p></span>and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p>Your Commitments</p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us. </p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. </p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under</p>
<p>applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an</p>
<p>applicable denied party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of</p>
<p>our policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information (including registration information).</p>
<p>Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an</p>
<p>account for someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal</strong></p>
<p><strong>or unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or</strong></p>

<p><strong>of the Service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way</p>

<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that</strong></p>
<p><strong>violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our</strong></p>
<p><strong>prior written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service. </p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license</strong></p>
<p><strong>to use it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim</p>
<p>ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when</p>
<p>you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights</p>
<p>(like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to</p>
<p>us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license</p>
<p>to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate,</p>
<p>and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and</p>
<p>application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content</p>
<p>or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others</p>
<p>and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and</p>
<p>how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the</p>
<p>Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about</strong></p>
<p><strong>your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored</strong></p>
<p><strong>content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information</p>
<p>about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in</p>
<p>connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you</p>
<p>follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any</p>
<p>compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored</p>
<p>post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with</p>
<p>actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored</p>
<p>content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who</p>
<p>have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad</p>
<p>settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on</strong></p>
<p><strong>your device.</strong></p>
<p>Additional Rights We Retain</p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it</p>
<p>if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes</p>
<p>someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we</p>
<p>provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our</p>
<p>content (but not yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written</p>
<p>permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract</p>
<p>source code from us.</p>
<p>Content Removal and Disabling or</p>
<p>Terminating Your Account</p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we</p>
<p>believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We</p>
<p>can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including</p>
<p>terminating or disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or</p>
<p>services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of</p>
<p>Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you</p>
<p>repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are</p>
<p>permitted or required to do so by law. If you believe your account has been</p>
<p>terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account,</p>
<p>consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies</p>
<p>and will still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the</p>
<p>section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will</p>
<p>still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p>Our Agreement and What Happens if</p>
<p>We Disagree</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of</p>
<p>our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related</p>
<p>services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will</p>
<p>also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will</p>
<p>be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with</p>
<p>this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail</p>
<p>to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our</p>
<p>ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will</p>
<p>work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE</p>
<p>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p>
<p>PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for</p>
<p>their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful</p>
<p>or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by</p>
<p>other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know</p>
<p>what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable")</p>
<p>for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect,</p>
<p>exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even</p>
<p>if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or</p>
<p>account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed</p>
<p>the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against</p>
<p>any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,</p>
<p>reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these</p>
<p>Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any</p>
<p>matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim</p>
<p>without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>
<p>Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized</p>
<p>ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and</p>
<p>enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. </p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that</p>
<p>you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park, CA</p>
<p>94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of</p>
<p>Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone</p>
<p>number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the</p>
<p>relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Facebook, Inc.,</p>
<p>ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we</p>
<p>commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use</p>
<p>with your Instagram account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a</p>
<p>dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may</p>
<p>commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees</p>
<p>for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely</p>
<p>provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including</p>
<p>rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will</p>
<p>be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a</p>
<p>state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal</p>
<p>jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p>Updating These Terms</p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.</p>

<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)<span style="background-color: red;"> cannot be</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">cannot be </span>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>claim (or only that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>requests for relief) remain<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"<span style="background-color: red;"> court,</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">court, </span>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Service.</p>

<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings<span style="background-color: red;">. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>

<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>

<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>

<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>

<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are <span style="background-color: red;">permitted or </span>required to do so by law. We can refuse to<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>

<p></span><span style="background-color: green;"> will notify you </span>(<span style="background-color: green;">for </span><span style="background-color: red;">"liabl</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">"</span><span style="background-color: green;">xample, through our Service</span>) <span style="background-color: red;">for </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ny los</span>t <span style="background-color: red;">profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequentia</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">, sp</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ci</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">l,</p>

<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within</span> 30 days <span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">of th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;"> date that y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u ag</span>re<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">to th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">se</span></p>

<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>

<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are <span style="background-color: green;">permitted or </span>required to do so by law. We can refuse to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>by law<span style="background-color: red;">. If we take action to remove your content for violating our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines, or disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where</p>
<p>appropriate</span>. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>

<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our Terms of Use are changing. You can view our previous Terms of Use here.</span></p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Service.</p>

<p>Service.</span></p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>
<p>Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual</p>
<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>

<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>

<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>

<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>

<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>

<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>

<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>

<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old<span style="background-color: green;"> or the minimum legal age in your country to use</p>
<p>Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>

<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>

<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>

<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>

<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>

<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>

<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>

<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If <span style="background-color: red;">we take action to disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where</p>
<p>appropriate. If </span>you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>

<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>

<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>

<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>

<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>

<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>

<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>

<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>

<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>

<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>

<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>

<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>

<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>

<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>

<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>

<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>

<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>

<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>

<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>

<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>

<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>

<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>

<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>

<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those</p>
<p>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>

<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>

<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>

<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>

<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply,</span> and provide information about the</p>

<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>

<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>

<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>

<p></span>Instagram users. If there is a final<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>request for particular relief)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">limitations, then only that </span>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>All other claims (or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>

<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>

<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>

<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or</p>
<p>legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our</p>
<p>Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's</p>
<p>intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We</p>
<p>can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information</p>
<p>shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that</p>
<p>doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory</p>
<p>impacts on us. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want</p>
<p>to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.When you</p>
<p>request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically</p>
<p>begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete</p>
<p>content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content</p>
<p>is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains</p>
<p>subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it</p>
<p>may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery</p>
<p>systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>

<p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to</p>
<p>any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or</p>
<p>relates to these Terms, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court</p>
<p>in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree</p>

<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved </span>exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>California or a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>state court located in San Mateo County<span style="background-color: green;">, that you submit to the personal</p>
<p>jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim,</p>
<p>and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any</p>
<p>claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">Wi</span><span style="background-color: red;">You also agree </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">h</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> s</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">t prejudice to the</p>

<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old<span style="background-color: red;"> or the minimum legal age in your country to use</p>
<p>Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>

<p>content in our Help Center.</p>

<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>

<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>

<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Privacy<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram Platform Policy</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong><strong>.</strong> Learn how to report conduct<span style="background-color: red;"> or</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or </span>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>
<p>Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual</p>
<p>property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or</p>
<p>upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on</p>
<p>or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,</p>
<p>copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your</p>
<p>content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this</p>
<p>license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to</p>
<p>appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about</p>
<p>how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data</p>
<p>Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you</p>
<p>create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies</p>
<p>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so</p>
<p>by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to</p>
<p>disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.</p>
<p>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will</p>
<p>still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below</p>
<p>called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after</p>
<p>your account is terminated or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or</p>
<p>related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms</p>
<p>that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment</p>
<p>features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of<span style="background-color: red;"> those</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">those </span>terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such</p>
<p>as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are</span>)<span style="background-color: red;">:</p>

<p><strong>Fost</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ring a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram</p>
<p>Privacy and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>

<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>

<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>

<p>dispute. Otherwise, t</span>his agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span><span style="background-color: red;"> claim, or</span></p>

<p></span>Instagram users. If there is a final<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>request for particular relief)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's<span style="background-color: red;"> limitations, then only that</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">limitations, then only that </span>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>All other claims (or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such</p>
<p>as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram</p>
<p>Privacy and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products)</p>
<p>immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal</p>
<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement, or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies.</p>
<p>If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>as</span> <span style="background-color: green;">as</p>
<p></span>information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>

<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products)</p>
<p>immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal</p>
<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement, or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>as</span> <span style="background-color: green;">as</p>
<p></span>information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong><span style="background-color: red;">
</span></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">
</span><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>

<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement, or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p></span>Terms of Use</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as</p>
<p>information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products)</p>
<p>immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal</p>
<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement, or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If</p>
<p>you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>

<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>

<p>Terms of Use</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as</p>
<p>information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products)</p>
<p>immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal</p>
<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>

<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If</p>
<p>you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>

<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>

<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>

<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>

<p>interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to</p>
<p>advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information</p>
<p>such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us</p>
<p>specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a</p>
<p>commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>

<p><strong></span>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>well as from third-party partners, to show you<span style="background-color: red;"> ads, offers, and other</span></p>

<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you acknowledge that we can show you ads<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>that businesses and organizations pay<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal</p>
<p>data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>don’t sell your personal data. We allow<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>advertisers to tell us things like their<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>their</span> <span style="background-color: red;">ad</span><span style="background-color: green;">their</span> <span style="background-color: green;">ad</p>
<p></span>to people who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>interacting with their content on and off Instagram.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to</p>
<p>advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information that directly identifies you (information<span style="background-color: red;"> such as your name or email</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">such as your name or email </span>address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you give us<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong></span>these Terms or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration<span style="background-color: green;"> on an</span></strong></p>

<p><strong></span>permitted</strong>; you and we may bring a claim only on<span style="background-color: red;"> your own behalf and cannot</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">your own behalf and cannot </span>seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final judicial<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">then only </span>that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>claims (or requests for relief) remain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>it. If you don't bring your claims<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show<span style="background-color: red;"> their ad</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">their ad </span>to people who might be interested.</p>
