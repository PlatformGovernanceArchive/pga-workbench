<p>Additional things to remember</p>
<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If</p>
<p>you are offended by a photo <span style="background-color: green;">or video </span>that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest<span style="background-color: red;"> you</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">you </span>navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the</p>
<p>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the</p>
<p>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your <span style="background-color: green;">post</span><span style="background-color: red;">image</span>s has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the <span style="background-color: green;">post</span><span style="background-color: red;">image</span> &amp;<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>politely</span> <span style="background-color: green;">politely</p>
<p></span>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we</span><span style="background-color: red;">may</span> <span style="background-color: green;">may</p>
<p></span>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream</p>
<p>in order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about</p>
<p>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as</p>
<p>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.</p>
<p>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs</p>
<p>our attention, this includes image<span style="background-color: green;"> or video</span> descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>
<p>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will</p>
<p>help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>

<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you</p>
<p>don’t share photos or videos of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos or</p>
<p>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If</p>
<p>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to double tap on the</p>
<p>post to like it!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young</p>
<p>as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our</p>
<p>product and the content within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In</p>
<p>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></li>

<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>

<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users</p>

<p>users to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>

<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If</p>
<p>you are offended by a photo or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest</p>
<p>you navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the</p>
<p>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the</p>
<p>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely</p>
<p>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream</p>
<p>in order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about</p>
<p>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as</p>
<p>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.</p>
<p>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs</p>
<p>our attention, this includes image or video descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>
<p>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will</p>
<p>help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>

<p>The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best</p>
<p>practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms</p>
<p>of Use.</p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you</p>
<p>don’t share photos or videos of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos or</p>
<p>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If</p>
<p>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to double tap on the</p>
<p>post to like it!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young</p>
<p>as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our</p>
<p>product and the content within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In</p>
<p>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of</p>
<p>users to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,</p>
<p>and see the world through others’ eyes.</p>
<p>What not to do:</p>
<p>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or</p>
<p>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</p>
<p>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or</p>
<p>your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile</p>
<p>photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to</p>
<p>Instagram may be discontinued.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></li>

<p>Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful moments from their lives, and when you</p>
<p>engage in self-promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that</p>
<p>moment with you feel sad inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service</p>
<p>manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam comments, such as</p>
<p>discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram</p>
<p>meaningful and genuine.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives</p>
<p>through photos and videos. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate</p>
<p>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your</p>
<p>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend users block all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further issues.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and</p>
<p>videos, any account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating</p>
<p>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit suicide will result in a disabled account without</p>
<p>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness,</p>
<p>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place</p>
<p>for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.</p>

<p>The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best<span style="background-color: red;"> practices</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">practices </span>as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>of Use.</p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you</p>
<p>don’t share photos or videos of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos or</p>
<p>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If</p>
<p>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to double tap on the</p>
<p>post to like it!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young</p>
<p>as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our</p>
<p>product and the content within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In</p>
<p>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>of</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of</p>
<p></span>users to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,</p>
<p>and see the world through others’ eyes.</p>
<p>What not to do:</p>
<p>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or</p>
<p>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</p>
<p>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or</p>
<p>your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile</p>
<p>photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to</p>
<p>Instagram may be discontinued.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of</p>
<p>extreme violence or gore, your account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which</p>
<p>may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it is neither possible nor permitted to</p>
<p>complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos are</p>

<li><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></li>

<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely</p>

<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,</p>
<p>and see the world through others’ eyes.</p>
<p>What not to do:</p>
<p>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or</p>
<p>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</p>
<p>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or</p>
<p>your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile</p>
<p>photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to</p>
<p>Instagram may be discontinued.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of</p>
<p>extreme violence or gore, your account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which</p>
<p>may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it is neither possible nor permitted to</p>
<p>complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos are</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">promoting the sale of regulated goods or services, including firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult</p>
<p></span><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives</p>
<p>through photos and videos. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate</p>
<p>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your</p>
<p>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend users block all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further issues.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and</p>
<p>videos, any account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating</p>
<p>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit suicide will result in a disabled account without</p>
<p>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness,</p>
<p>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place</p>
<p>for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.</p>
<p>Additional things to remember</p>
<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If</p>
<p>you are offended by a photo or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest</p>
<p>you navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the</p>
<p>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the</p>
<p>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely</p>
<p>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream</p>
<p>in order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about</p>
<p>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as</p>
<p>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.</p>
<p>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs<span style="background-color: red;"> our</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">our </span>attention, this includes image or video descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>
<p>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will</p>
<p>help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>

<li><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives</p>
<p>through photos and videos. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate</p>
<p>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your</p>
<p>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend people block all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further issues.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and</p>
<p>videos, any account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating</p>
<p>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit suicide will result in a disabled account without</p>
<p>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness,</p>
<p>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place</p>
<p>for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.</p>
<p>Additional things to remember</p>
<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If</p>
<p>you are offended by a photo or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest</p>
<p>you navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the</p>
<p>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the</p>
<p>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another person’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely</p>
<p>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream</p>
<p>in order to draw attention to the situation or person, but that’s often not the best way to go about</p>
<p>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the person, as it may be classified as</p>
<p>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.</p>
<p>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs</p>
<p>our attention, this includes image or video descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>
<p>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will</p>
<p>help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>

<p>The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best</p>
<p>practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms</p>
<p>of Use.</p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you</p>
<p>don’t share photos or videos of someone else’s life. Since people own the rights to all photos or</p>
<p>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If</p>
<p>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to double tap on the</p>
<p>post to like it!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young</p>
<p>as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our</p>
<p>product and the content within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In</p>
<p>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that everyone be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. People</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of</p>
<p>accounts to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,</p>
<p>and see the world through others’ eyes.</p>
<p>What not to do:</p>
<p>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or</p>
<p>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</p>
<p>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or</p>
<p>your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile</p>
<p>photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to</p>
<p>Instagram may be discontinued. While we know that families use Instagram to capture and share</p>
<p>photos of their children, we may remove images that show nude or partially nude children for safety</p>
<p>reasons. Even when these images are uploaded with the best of intentions, this content could be re-</p>
<p>shared and used by other people in unanticipated and inappropriate ways. You can learn more on</p>
<p>our Tips for Parents page.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center</p>
<p>extreme violence or gore, your account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which</p>
<p>may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it is neither possible nor permitted to</p>
<p>complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos are</p>
<p>promoting the sale of regulated goods or services, including firearms, alcohol, tobacco, prescription</p>
<p>drugs, or adult products, we expect you to make sure you’re following the law and to encourage</p>
<p>others to do the same.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t spam.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful moments from their lives, and when you</p>
<p>engage in self-promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes people who have shared that</p>
<p>moment with you feel sad inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service</p>
<p>manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam comments, such as</p>
<p>discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram</p>
<p>meaningful and genuine.</p>

<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>through photos and videos. It<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>we’ll send a warning or disable your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms</p>
<p>of Use.</p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ol>
<li></span><strong>Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>don’t share photos or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>videos of someone else’s life. Since people own the rights to all photos or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that you respect their copyright ownership. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">1</p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">2. </span><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>as 13 years old. While we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>product and the content within it in line with our App<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">3. <strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></p>
<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that everyone be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. People</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of</p>
<p>accounts to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>

<li><strong>Do have fun!</strong></li>

<p><strong>Do have fun!</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others, and see the world through</p>
<p>others’ eyes.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></p>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet. Accounts that solely</p>
<p>consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></p>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you probably</p>

<p>Additional things to remember</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing service, as Instagram may</p>
<p>not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>
<p>If you need further information, you can check out our Support Center and Terms of Use.</p>
<p>The Instagram Team</p>
<p>shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content</p>
<p>will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued. While we know that families use Instagram to capture and</p>
<p>share photos of their children, we may remove images that show nude or partially nude children for safety reasons. Even when</p>
<p>these images are uploaded with the best of intentions, this content could be re-shared and used by other people in</p>
<p>unanticipated and inappropriate ways. You can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></p>
<p>If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of extreme violence or gore, your</p>
<p>account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it</p>
<p>is neither possible nor permitted to complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos</p>
<p>are promoting the sale of regulated goods or services, including firearms, alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or adult</p>
<p>products, we expect you to make sure you’re following the law and to encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful moments from their lives, and when you engage in self-promotional</p>
<p>behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes people who have shared that moment with you feel sad inside. This guideline</p>
<p>includes repetitive comments, as well as service manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam</p>
<p>comments, such as </span>discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> meaningful and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">g</span><span style="background-color: green;">m</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">u</span>in<span style="background-color: green;">gful and g</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nuine</span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">4</p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">5. </span><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>through photos and videos. It<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>we’ll send a warning or disable your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend people block all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>issues.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">5</p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">6. </span><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></p>
<p>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>videos, any account found<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>suicide will result in a disabled account without<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>create awareness,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place<span style="background-color: red;"> for</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">for </span>active promotion or glorification of self-harm.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">6</span><span style="background-color: green;">Additional things to remember</span></p>
<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you are offended by a photo<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you navigate away from the account, or even use our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>blocking feature. If you are unsure about the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>bring it to the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another person’s profile, try not to panic. It is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>likely a misunderstanding<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>work, please file a DMCA report so that we may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream<span style="background-color: red;"> in order to draw attention to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">in order to draw attention to </span>the situation or person, but that’s often not the best way to go about<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>person, as it may be classified as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Please provide all<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>our attention, this includes image or video<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>

<p>How can we help?</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>

To protect people, we may also remove</p>
<p>content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>

Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn or raise awareness. If you</p>
<p>do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning a</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">ited </span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">r illegal con</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>The Short</p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p>The Long</p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in a disabled account.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your region), as</p>
<p>well as promoting recreational drug use is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law</p>
<p>when offering to sell or buy regulated goods, including firearms, alcohol, and tobacco. You can learn</p>
<p>more on our Regulated Goods and Services page.<span style="background-color: green;"> Accounts promoting online gambling, online real</p>

<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>

<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>

<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your region), as</p>
<p>well as promoting recreational drug use is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law</p>
<p>when offering to sell or buy regulated goods, including firearms, alcohol, and tobacco. You can learn</p>
<p>more on our Regulated Goods and Services page. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real</p>
<p>money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our</p>
<p>products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. To protect people, we may also remove</p>
<p>content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn or raise awareness. If you</p>
<p>do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about</p>
<p>graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review the content</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the community guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it, and if there's something you don't like in a</p>
<p>comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can always file a</p>
<p>copyright report so we can investigate. Or, if you believe someone is violating your trademark, you</p>
<p>can file a trademark report. Don't target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and</p>
<p>drawing attention to the situation because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>To help keep the community safe, there are times when we work with law enforcement including</p>
<p>when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.</p>

<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>

<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>

<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>

<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>

<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>

<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>

<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>

<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</span></p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>

<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>

<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>

<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>

<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>

<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>

<p></span>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>The Long<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>

<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</span></p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p>Help us keep the community strong:</p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>

<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p>Help us keep the community strong:</p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>

<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>

<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>

<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>

<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>

<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>

<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>

<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>

<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>

<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>

<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</span></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>

<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>

<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>

<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>

<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>

<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other</p>
<p>regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online</p>
<p>lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>

<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your</p>
<p>region) is also not allowed. <span style="background-color: green;">Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private</p>
<p>individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching</p>

<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>

<p></span><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>

<p>species or their parts.</p>

<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

</span></p><p><h1>20190828063140_vs_20190904203813</h1></p><p>Community Guidelines</p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>

<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>

<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>

<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>

<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>

<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent.<span style="background-color: green;"> Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the</p>
<p>offering, solicitation and trade of fake user reviews.</span></p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>

<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong><em>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</em></strong> <em>As people around the world confront this</em></p>
<p><em>unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people</em></p>
<p><em>from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has</em></p>
<p><em>the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm,</em></p>
<p><em>sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that</em></p>
<p><em>contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we continue to look at</em></p>
<p><em>content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy</em></p>
<p><em>guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the</p>
<p>offering, solicitation and trade of fake user reviews.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>

<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>

<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong><em>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</em></strong> <em>As people around the world confront this</em></p>
<p><em>unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people</em></p>
<p><em>from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has</em></p>
<p><em>the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm,</em></p>
<p><em>sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that</em></p>
<p><em>contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we continue to look at</em></p>
<p><em>content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy</em></p>
<p><em>guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest</p>
<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>

<p><em>unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people</em></p>
<p><em>from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has</em></p>
<p><em>the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm,</em></p>
<p><em>sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that</em></p>

<p><em>content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy</em></p>
<p><em>guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest</p>
<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span></strong></p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p>Help us keep the community strong:</p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>

<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>

<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>

<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>

<p></span>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>

<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>

<p><strong><em>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</em></strong> <em>As people around the world confront this</em></p>
<p><em>unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people</em></p>
<p><em>from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has</em></p>
<p><em>the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm,</em></p>
<p><em>sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that</em></p>
<p><em>contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we continue to look at</em></p>
<p><em>content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy</em></p>
<p><em>guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest</p>
<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>

<p></span>possible,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>quickly. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a<span style="background-color: red;"> comment</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">comment </span>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Don't<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>

<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>accounts, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest</p>
<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>shared</span> <span style="background-color: green;">shared</p>
<p></span>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>violence is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Help us keep the community strong:</strong></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>
