<p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection, use and disclosure of your personally</p>
<p>identifiable information (“PII”) by SoundCloud Ltd. (“SOUNDCLOUD”) in relation to your use of</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD’s Internet platform at www.soundcloud.com (hereinafter “Website”) and any</p>
<p>services that SOUNDCLOUD provides through this Website (hereinafter “Services”). </p>
<p>When we use the term personally identifiable information (“PII”) in this Privacy Policy, we mean</p>
<p>information that would allow someone to identify you, such as your name, address, location or</p>
<p>email address.</p>
<p>You decide which personal information you provide to SOUNDCLOUD. SOUNDCLOUD is fully</p>
<p>committed to respecting your privacy, protecting the information you provide to us and to complying</p>
<p>with the applicable data protection laws and regulations.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>1. What kind of PII do we collect?<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You can visit our Website and use some of our Services without registering and providing any personal data. In the</p>
<p>following instances, SOUNDCLOUD may collect PII you provide:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> When you register to establish a free user account for our Service on our Website, you provide your email address</p>
<p>and may also provide additional information, e.g. a pseudonym or your real name, your location, information on how</p>
<p>you use music, the URL of your website and information regarding other music services you are using, e.g. your</p>
<p>Discog name or your MySpace URL. You may also upload a picture of yourself or another image as an avatar/profile</p>
<p>picture on your profile. You may change or delete this information at any time under “Settings” in your account.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> When you register to establish a premium user account for our Service on our Website you also provide your real</p>
<p>name, address and payment information necessary for us to receive payment.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> When you send us an email, you provide your email address and may also provide additional PII.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> When you participate in our forums or blogs, you may provide PII.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>2. What do we do with your PII?<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(a) Registered Users.</strong>  When you register to obtain a user account on our Website (“Registered User”), we ask you to</p>
<p>provide your email address to create your account and establish a password and profile. Providing your real name</p>
<p>and any additional PII is optional for the free account. Providing your email address will allow us to send you your</p>
<p>password if you should forget it. If you voluntarily provide your real name in connection with any content you submit to</p>
<p>the Website, in addition to your email address, your name may be associated with the content you contributed. We will</p>
<p>also use that PII to establish and maintain your account (e.g. to send you important information about Service updates</p>
<p>or customer surveys) and provide you with the features we provide for Registered Users, e.g. for the purpose of</p>
<p>sending you our monthly newsletter as provided in Section 2(e) below.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Public Page.</strong> Registered Users on the Website are automatically provided with a public page where you may post</p>
<p>PII for public viewing. You are not required to post PII or any other information or content on this page, but may post it</p>
<p>in your own sole discretion (although any information posted remains subject to SOUNDCLOUD’s Terms of Use).</p>
<p>Please note that the information you publish on your public page, including your PII but not your email address,</p>
<p>becomes public information that can be viewed by others and that the data shown on the Website including PII you</p>
<p>provide in your public profile can be accessed through the Internet (directly on our Website or through</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD’s Application Programming Interface) and thus worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>(c) “Connect with SoundCloud”.</strong> You may share the information from your public page on SOUNDCLOUD with other</p>
<p>websites through “Connect with SoundCloud” upon your explicit prior consent and may revoke access of such other</p>
<p>websites to your public profile on SOUNDCLOUD at any time. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot</p>
<p>control the activities of, such other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party</p>
<p>sites.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Premium Account.</strong> If you subscribe to a premium account, we use and retain your PII to provide you with the</p>
<p>relevant agreement, to process your application and to collect payment. If we ask you for your payment information, we</p>
<p>transfer this information in a secured format. SOUNDCLOUD uses the industry standard security protocol SSL</p>
<p>(Secure Socket Layer). SOUNDCLOUD does not sell or otherwise distribute your payment information.</p>
<p><strong>(e) Emails, Newsletters and Notifications.</strong> We use the PII you provide to us when you send us emails to respond to</p>
<p>your request, for example to reply to your email. We also use your PII when you sign up as a Registered User to use</p>
<p>our Services in order to send you notifications relating to your account and if you do not object to the use of your email</p>

<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings at</p>
<p>the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings page.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”. By</p>

<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open A</span>PI<span style="background-color: green;">, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>

<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> There</p>
<p>are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you</p>
<p>provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>

<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties. None of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that</p>
<p>could be used to identify you in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most other websites, we use cookies to help us improve the Website and the Services we provide.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by</p>
<p>these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session”</p>
<p>cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”). Google Analytics uses cookies to</p>
<p>help us analyze how users use the Website, and any SoundCloud® players embedded on third party sites. The</p>
<p>information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website and SoundCloud® players (including your</p>

<p>information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Website and SoundCloud® players,</p>
<p>compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet</p>
<p>usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify</p>
<p>(approximately) the country from which you are visiting the Website, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your</p>
<p>computer or mobile device, individually. You can find more information on Google Analytics here, including a link to</p>

<p>marketing messages relevant to your use of the platform. The information generated by the cookie about your use of</p>
<p>the Website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Quantcast on servers in the United States.</p>
<p>Quantcast will use this information, together with information it collects from other websites that you may visit, for the</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings at</p>
<p>the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings enables you to control the information you share with other networks and</p>
<p>applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to</p>
<p>other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”. By</p>
<p>checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to</p>
<p>this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties. None of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that</p>
<p>could be used to identify you in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>

<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most other websites, we use cookies to help us improve the Website and the Services we provide.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by</p>
<p>these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session”</p>
<p>cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted</p>
<p>as soon as you close your web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”). Google Analytics uses cookies to</p>
<p>help us analyze how users use the Website, and any SoundCloud® players embedded on third party sites. The</p>
<p>information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website and SoundCloud® players (including your</p>
<p>truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this</p>
<p>information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Website and SoundCloud® players,</p>
<p>compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet</p>
<p>usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify</p>
<p>(approximately) the country from which you are visiting the Website, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your</p>
<p>computer or mobile device, individually. You can find more information on Google Analytics here, including a link to</p>
<p>Google’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>marketing messages relevant to your use of the platform. The information generated by the cookie about your use of</p>
<p>the Website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Quantcast on servers in the United States.</p>
<p>Quantcast will use this information, together with information it collects from other websites that you may visit, for the</p>

<p>the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings at</p>
<p>the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings enables you to control the information you share with other networks and</p>
<p>applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to</p>
<p>other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”. By</p>
<p>checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to</p>
<p>this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>

<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties. None of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that</p>
<p>could be used to identify you in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most other websites, we use cookies to help us improve the Website and the Services we provide.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by</p>
<p>these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session”</p>
<p>cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted</p>
<p>as soon as you close your web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”). Google Analytics uses cookies to</p>
<p>help us analyze how users use the Website, and any SoundCloud® players embedded on third party sites. The</p>
<p>information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website and SoundCloud® players (including your</p>
<p>truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this</p>
<p>information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Website and SoundCloud® players,</p>
<p>compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet</p>
<p>usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify</p>
<p>(approximately) the country from which you are visiting the Website, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your</p>
<p>computer or mobile device, individually. You can find more information on Google Analytics here, including a link to</p>
<p>Google’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>For information on how to opt-out of having your data collected by Google, please see the “Cookies” paragraph in the</p>

<p>marketing messages relevant to your use of the platform. The information generated by the cookie about your use of</p>
<p>the Website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Quantcast on servers in the United States.</p>
<p>Quantcast will use this information, together with information it collects from other websites that you may visit, for the</p>
<p>purpose of evaluating your behaviour across the web and compiling reports for us on your website activity. All</p>

<p>the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings at</p>
<p>the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings enables you to control the information you share with other networks and</p>
<p>applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to</p>
<p>other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”. By</p>
<p>checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to</p>
<p>this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> There</p>
<p>are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you</p>
<p>provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent:We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In</p>
<p>particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your SoundCloud® account to</p>
<p>other social networks, or have elected to have your activity on the Platform published to other networks such as</p>
<p>Facebook. For information on how to control the information that your share, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties<span style="background-color: green;"> or make publicly available</span>. None of this information would include any email address or other contact<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>

<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”<span style="background-color: green;"> on the Website</span>. When you are logged in to your account, you can access<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your Settings at<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings <span style="background-color: red;">enables y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u to co</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">trol</span> the <span style="background-color: green;">W</span><span style="background-color: red;">information you shar</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> w</span><span style="background-color: green;">bs</span>it<span style="background-color: red;">h oth</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p></span>networks and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also<span style="background-color: red;"> control access to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">control access to </span>other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”<span style="background-color: green;"> on the</p>
<p>Website</span>. By<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have<span style="background-color: red;"> access to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">access to </span>this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p><strong>Deleting your account</strong></p>
<p>You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your</p>
<p>account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data</p>
<p>associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back</p>
<p>up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you</p>
<p>will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is</p>
<p>connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party</p>
<p>app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from</p>
<p>that third party app.</p>
<p></span>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the</p>
<p>“Settings” page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information</p>
<p>we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please</p>
<p>contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by email (to the then current email address provided in their</p>
<p>account), by a notification to their account, and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website.</p>

<p>your first name, last name, gender, general location, a link to your Facebook profile, your timezone, birthday, profile</p>

<p>on SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. If you do</p>
<p>not wish to share your SoundCloud® activity with your Facebook friends, you can control this from the “Settings” page</p>
<p>– for more information, see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>our email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p>
<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API.</p>
<p>Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about yourself.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to a premium account, your name, address and payment verification information will be used to</p>
<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>
<p>using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SoundCloud also complies with the Payment Card</p>
<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers a SoundCloud® account, we will suggest</p>
<p>to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of</p>
<p>those Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Services, in order to improve</p>
<p>SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> There</p>
<p>are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you</p>
<p>provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent:We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In</p>
<p>particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your SoundCloud® account to</p>
<p>other social networks, or have elected to have your activity on the Platform published to other networks such as</p>
<p>Facebook. For information on how to control the information that your share, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. None of this information would include any email address or other contact</p>
<p>information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most other websites, we use cookies to help us improve the Website and the Services we provide.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by</p>
<p>these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session”</p>
<p>cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted</p>
<p>as soon as you close your web browser.</p>
<p>In addition to our own cookies, the following reputable companies also drop cookies from our Website and mobile</p>
<p>apps:</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”). Google Analytics uses cookies to</p>

<p>information generated by the cookie about your use of the Platform (including your truncated IP address) is</p>
<p>transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose</p>
<p>of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Website and SoundCloud® players, compiling reports for us on</p>
<p>website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Please note that Google</p>
<p>only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which</p>
<p>you are visiting the Website, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually. You can</p>
<p>find more information on Google Analytics here, including a link to Google’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>For information on how to opt-out of having your data collected by Google, please see the “Cookies” paragraph in the</p>

<p>mobile apps. ATInternet uses cookies to gather information about your use of our Website and mobile apps, and the</p>
<p>information generated by these cookies (including your truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by</p>
<p>ATInternet on servers in the European Union. ATInternet uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and</p>
<p>other users’, use of our mobile apps, compiling reports for us on Website and app activity and providing other</p>
<p>services relating to Website and app activity and usage. Please note that ATInternet only receives your truncated IP</p>

<p>ATInternet here, including a link to ATInternet’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>For information on how to opt-out of having your data collected by ATInternet, please see the “Cookies” paragraph in</p>
<p>the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings” on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access</p>
<p>your Settings at the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings</p>
<p>page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p>Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have</p>
<p>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>To opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics on the Website and other websites, please visit</p>

<p>To opt-out of being tracked by ATInternet on our Website and mobile apps, please visit</p>

<p>Please Note: We have done our best to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our use of</p>
<p>cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Website without blocking or disabling these technologies,</p>
<p>you consent to our use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of any personal information that we collect using these</p>
<p>technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting your account</strong></p>
<p>You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your</p>
<p>account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data</p>
<p>associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back</p>
<p>up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you</p>
<p>will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is</p>
<p>connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party</p>
<p>app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from</p>
<p>that third party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the</p>
<p>“Settings” page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information</p>
<p>we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please</p>
<p>contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by email (to the then current email address provided in their</p>
<p>account), by a notification to their account, and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> There</p>
<p>are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you</p>
<p>provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent:We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In</p>
<p>particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your SoundCloud® account to</p>
<p>other social networks, or have elected to have your activity on the Platform published to other networks such as</p>
<p>Facebook. For information on how to control the information that your share, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. None of this information would include any email address or other contact</p>
<p>information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings” on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access</p>
<p>your Settings at the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings</p>
<p>page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p>Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have</p>
<p>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>Please Note: We have done our best to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our use of</p>
<p>cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Website without blocking or disabling these technologies,</p>
<p>you consent to our use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of any personal information that we collect using these</p>
<p>technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting your account</strong></p>
<p>You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your</p>
<p>account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data</p>
<p>associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back</p>
<p>up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you</p>
<p>will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is</p>
<p>connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party</p>
<p>app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from</p>
<p>that third party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the</p>
<p>“Settings” page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information</p>
<p>we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please</p>
<p>contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>

<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>For information on your choices regarding<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Email preferences<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings” on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access</p>
<p>your Settings at the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings</p>
<p>page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Sharing with other networks<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span><strong>If you do not want this information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></strong></p>
<p><strong></span>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Sharing with other users<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p>Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have</p>
<p>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Sharing with app developers<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Cookies<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>Please Note: We have done our best to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our use of</p>
<p>cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Website without blocking or disabling these technologies,</p>
<p>you consent to our use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of any personal information that we collect using these</p>
<p>technologies.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Deleting your account<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your</p>
<p>account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data</p>
<p>associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back</p>
<p>up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you</p>
<p>will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is</p>
<p>connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party</p>
<p>app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from</p>
<p>that third party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the</p>
<p>“Settings” page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information</p>
<p>we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please</p>
<p>contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>

<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>

<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other networks</p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. </p>
<p><strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p></span>Website. By checking this box,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.<span style="background-color: green;"> Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</span></p>

<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>

<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. </p>
<p><strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>
<p>Questions?</p>

<p>information we store about you, please contact us by email at privacy@soundcloud.com, or write to us at:</p>

<p>you post on SoundCloud® and any new favourites, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your</p>

<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and certain email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will</p>
<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. </p>
<p><strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>
<p>Questions?</p>

<p>information we store about you, please contact us by email at privacy@soundcloud.com, or write to us at:</p>

<p>you post on SoundCloud® and any new favourites, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your</p>

<p>and Control section below. If you signed up using Facebook by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account</p>
<p>page within your Settings at any time, or you can email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p>
<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or</p>
<p>other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about</p>
<p>yourself.</p>

<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>
<p>using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SoundCloud also complies with the Payment Card</p>
<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and certain email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>

<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>

<p>Documentation</p>
<p></span>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>
<p>Questions?</p>

<p>you post on SoundCloud® and any new favourites, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your</p>
<p>timeline and your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. If you do not wish to share your SoundCloud® activity with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends, you can control this from the Settings page on the Website – for more information, see the Choice</p>
<p>and Control section below. If you signed up using Facebook by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account</p>
<p>page within your Settings at any time, or you can email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p>
<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or</p>
<p>other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about</p>
<p>yourself.</p>

<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>
<p>using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SoundCloud also complies with the Payment Card</p>
<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and certain email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will</p>
<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>

<p>Documentation</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>Facebook account, and information regarding your activity on SoundCloud®, specifically any new public sounds that</p>
<p>you post on SoundCloud® and any new favourites, will be shared with Facebook and will be published in your</p>
<p>timeline and your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. If you do not wish to share your SoundCloud® activity with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends, you can control this from the Settings page on the Website – for more information, see the Choice</p>
<p>and Control section below. If you signed up using Facebook by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account</p>
<p>page within your Settings at any time, or you can email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p>
<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or</p>
<p>other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about</p>
<p>yourself.</p>

<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>
<p>using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SoundCloud also complies with the Payment Card</p>
<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and certain email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will</p>
<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>

<p>Documentation</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>For your convenience, information relating to our use of cookies and similar technologies is set out in a separate</p>
<p>Cookies Policy. The Cookies Policy forms part of ths Privacy Policy, and whenever we refer to the Privacy Policy, we</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Website, the Apps and the Services (together, the “<strong>Platform</strong>”).</p>
<p>When using the Platform, you may find links to other websites, apps and services, or tools that enable you to share</p>
<p>information with other websites, apps and services. SoundCloud is not responsible for the privacy practices of these</p>
<p>other websites, apps and services and we recommend that you review the privacy policies of each of these websites,</p>
<p>apps or services before connecting your SoundCloud® account or sharing any personal information.</p>
<p>Our Principles</p>
<p>We have a pretty simple approach to data protection and privacy, which can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>You should know exactly what we do with your data</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to give you full transparency regarding our data protection practices. If there’s anything</p>
<p>that’s not clear from this Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>You should have full control over your data</p>
<p>We’ve designed the Website to give you control over the information you publish and share using SoundCloud® and</p>
<p>other sites and services to which you connect your SoundCloud® account. Please take full advantage of these tools</p>
<p>and make sure you only share what you want to share.</p>

<p>We collect personal information about you from various sources:</p>
<p>Information provided by you</p>
<p>You don’t need to provide us with any personal information in order to visit the Website. However, certain Services do</p>
<p>require that you register for a SoundCloud® account and, by doing so, you will provide us with certain personal</p>
<p>information:</p>
<p>Essential Information: When you register any kind of SoundCloud® account, you will need to provide your email</p>

<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or</p>
<p>other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to a premium account, your name, address and payment verification information will be used to</p>
<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>
<p>using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SoundCloud also complies with the Payment Card</p>
<p>Industry Security Standards.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you service updates and notifications regarding your account, and (if you</p>
<p>have elected to receive them using your account preferences) newsletters, marketing messages and certain email</p>
<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will</p>
<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any</p>
<p>new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.</p>
<p>In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.</p>
<p>This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not</p>
<p>responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or</p>
<p>services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect</p>
<p>your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook</p>
<p>account will be connected automatically, and information regarding the public sounds that you post or favourite on</p>
<p>SoundCloud®, will be shared with Facebook and will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’</p>
<p>newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS and Android apps to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. Simply go</p>
<p>to the settings screen on your iOS or Android device, and disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics</p>
<p>data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>

<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>

<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p><strong></span>you do not want this information shared with Facebook<span style="background-color: green;"> or Google</span>, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>

<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>For your convenience, information relating to our use of cookies and similar technologies is set out in a separate</p>
<p>Cookies Policy. The Cookies Policy forms part of ths Privacy Policy, and whenever we refer to the Privacy Policy, we</p>
<p>are referring to the Privacy Policy incorporating the Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Please take some time to read this Privacy Policy (including the Cookies Policy), and make sure you are happy with</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Website, the Apps and the Services (together, the “<strong>Platform</strong>”).</p>
<p>When using the Platform, you may find links to other websites, apps and services, or tools that enable you to share</p>
<p>information with other websites, apps and services. Sound</span>Cloud<span style="background-color: red;"> is not responsible for the privacy practices of these</span></p>

<p>Our Principles</p>
<p>We have a pretty simple approach to data protection and privacy, which can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>You should know exactly what we do with your data</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to give you full transparency regarding our data protection practices. If there’s anything</p>
<p>that’s not clear from this Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>You should have full control over your data</p>
<p>We’ve designed the Website to give you control over the information you publish and share using SoundCloud® and</p>
<p>other sites and services to which you connect your SoundCloud® account. Please take full advantage of these tools</p>
<p>and make sure you only share what you want to share.</p>
<p>Information we collect about you</p>
<p>We collect personal information about you from various sources:</p>
<p>Information provided by you</p>
<p>You don’t need to provide us with any personal information in order to visit the Website. However, certain Services do</p>
<p>require that you register for a SoundCloud® account and, by doing so, you will provide us with certain personal</p>
<p>information:</p>
<p>Essential Information: When you register any kind of SoundCloud® account, you will need to provide your email</p>
<p>address and choose a password. In addition, if you register a premium account, you will also need to provide your</p>
<p>real name, address and payment verification information.</p>
<p>Profile Information: You may choose, at your discretion, to provide additional information for your public profile on</p>

<p>the city and country in which you live</p>
<p>a profile picture or avatar</p>

<p>web analytics services as described in our Cookies Policy. This information includes:</p>
<p>the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device from which you access the Platform (this can sometimes be used</p>
<p>to derive the country or city from which you are accessing the Platform)</p>
<p>the site that you visited immediately prior to visiting the Website</p>

<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>

<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>

<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Your email address and password are used to identify you when you log into the Platform.</p>
<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or</p>
<p>other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to a premium account, your name, address and payment verification information will be used to</p>
<p>process your account subscription and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted</p>

<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will</p>
<p>suggest to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>If you are a Google+ user, and one of your Google+ friends registers for a SoundCloud® account, we will suggest</p>
<p>to your Google+ friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you are a Google+ user and sign up using Google+, we may also use the information we receive about you from</p>
<p>Google to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you if you</p>
<p>choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>
<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>

<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of</p>
<p>the change on the Website.</p>

<p>When using the Platform, you may find links to other websites, apps and services, or tools that enable you to share</p>
<p>information with other websites, apps and services. SoundCloud is not responsible for the privacy practices of these</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to give you full transparency regarding our data protection practices. If there’s anything</p>
<p>that’s not clear from this Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>You should have full control over your data</p>
<p>We’ve designed the Website to give you control over the information you publish and share using SoundCloud® and</p>
<p>other sites and services to which you connect your SoundCloud® account. Please take full advantage of these tools</p>
<p>and make sure you only share what you want to share.</p>

<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>

<p>If you are a Google+ user and sign up using Google+, we may also use the information we receive about you from</p>

<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>

<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>

<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>

<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>

<p>If you are a Facebook user and sign up using Facebook, we may also use the information we receive about you</p>
<p>from Facebook to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you</p>
<p>if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time.</p>

<p>If you are a Google+ user and sign up using Google+, we may also use the information we receive about you from</p>
<p>Google to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on SoundCloud®. It will be up to you if you</p>

<p>Your personal information is also used for the following general purposes:</p>
<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of the</p>
<p>Apps and any Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>
<p>contributions that you make to the Platform.</p>
<p>To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyse the results of those surveys if you choose to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>To provide you with technical support</p>
<p>To provide other users with data regarding people streaming and downloading their sounds.</p>
<p>To analyse the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order</p>
<p>to improve SoundCloud®.</p>
<p>To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.</p>
<p>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may</p>
<p>send to you from time to time.</p>
<p>To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our Terms of Use, Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or applicable law.</p>
<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
<p>party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings</p>
<p>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold</p>
<p>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please contact us</p>
<p>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
