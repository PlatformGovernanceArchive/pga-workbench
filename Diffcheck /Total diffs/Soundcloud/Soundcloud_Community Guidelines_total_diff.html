<p>(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)</p>
<p>The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of</p>
<p>SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud</p>
<p>is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do's</p>
<p>Always be nice</p>
<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect</p>
<p>somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at abuse@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.</p>
<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your</p>
<p>opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,</p>
<p>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I</p>
<p>appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don'ts</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>This of course means music but also texts &amp; images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and</p>
<p>sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator or the creator of what you're uploading has</p>
<p>given you permission share.</p>
<p>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders</p>
<p>Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to</p>
<p>the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to send &amp; receive music, please help us in making</p>
<p>sure it's all legal music.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account</p>
<p>deleted.</p>

<p>is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do's</p>
<p>Always be nice</p>
<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect</p>
<p>somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at abuse@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.</p>
<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>

<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect</p>
<p>somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at <span style="background-color: red;">abu</span><span style="background-color: green;">copyright</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>@soundcloud.com</p>

<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your</p>

<p>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I</p>
<p>appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don'ts</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>This of course means music but also texts &amp; images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and</p>
<p>sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading OR THEIR AGENT</p>
<p>has given you permission TO share.</p>
<p>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders</p>
<p>Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to</p>
<p>the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to send &amp; receive music, please help us in making</p>
<p>sure it's all legal music.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll, spam or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account</p>
<p>deleted. Please do not link to e-commerce, business and non-music related sites. We consider this spam and</p>
<p>nobody really likes spam.</p>
<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are</strong></p>
<p><strong>appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that</p>
<p>this should be a place of respect between people and responsible content posting. We hope you agree and</p>
<p>understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>

<p>(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)</p>
<p>The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of</p>
<p>SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud</p>
<p>is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do's</p>
<p>Always be nice</p>
<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the rights holders of a piece of music and never ever share music that you don't own the rights to,</p>
<p>period. If you suspect somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at</p>
<p>copyright<span style="background-color: red;">s</span>@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.</p>
<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your</p>
<p>opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,</p>
<p>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I</p>
<p>appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don'ts</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>This of course means music but also texts &amp; images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and</p>
<p>sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading OR THEIR AGENT</p>
<p>has given you permission TO share.</p>
<p>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders</p>
<p>Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to</p>
<p>the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to share &amp; receive music, please help us in making</p>
<p>sure it's all legal music.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll, spam or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account</p>
<p>deleted. Please do not link to e-commerce, business and non-music related sites. We consider this spam and</p>
<p>nobody really likes spam.</p>
<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are</strong></p>
<p><strong>appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that</p>
<p>this should be a place of respect between people and responsible content posting. We hope you agree and</p>
<p>understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>

<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us now.</p>

</span></p><p><h1>20111010221822_vs_20111121170933</h1></p><p>Community Guidelines</p>
<p>These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the SoundCloud</p>
<p>community is all about. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>
<p>everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that</p>
<p>someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending an email to support@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember â only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload</p>
<p>something, check out our Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Our widgets enable you to take tracks from SoundCloud and embed them on other websites. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so weâd really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but only when itâs done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other peopleâs content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone elseâs name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone elseâs trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email to support@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Thereâs a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your message</p>
<p>personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Please do not link to e-commerce or other</p>
<p>similar sites (other than through âbuyâ links in the player), or use sounds or comments to promote other products</p>
<p>or services. We consider this spam and nobody really likes spam. Comments, messages and forum posts sent</p>
<p>via bots will result in immediate deletion of accounts.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings within the space of a year, we <strong>will terminate your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may terminate</p>
<p>your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use â including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email to support@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - itâs up to all</p>

<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone elseâs trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email<span style="background-color: red;"> to support@soundcloud.com</span>.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Thereâs a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your message</p>
<p>personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Please do not link to e-commerce or other</p>
<p>similar sites (other than through âbuyâ links in the player), or use sounds or comments to promote other products</p>
<p>or services. We consider this spam and nobody really likes spam. Comments, messages and forum posts sent</p>
<p>via bots will result in immediate deletion of accounts.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings within the space of a year, we <strong>will terminate your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may terminate</p>
<p>your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use â including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email<span style="background-color: red;"> to support@soundcloud.com</span>.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - itâs up to all</p>

<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>
<p>for any updates.</p>
<p><em>The SoundCloud Team</em></p><p><h1>20120802220835_vs_20120817141748</h1></p><p>Community Guidelines</p>
<p>These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the SoundCloud</p>
<p>community is all about. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>
<p>everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that</p>
<p>someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending an email.</p>
<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember â only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload</p>
<p>something, check out our Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Our widgets enable you to take tracks from SoundCloud and embed them on other websites. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so weâd really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but only when itâs done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other peopleâs content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone elseâs name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>

<p>These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the</p>
<p>SoundCloud community is all about. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud is also subject to</p>
<p>our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>
<p>everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that</p>
<p>someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending an email.</p>
<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember â only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload</p>
<p>something, check out our Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Our widgets enable you to take tracks from SoundCloud and embed them on other websites. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so weâd really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but only when itâs done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other peopleâs content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone elseâs name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone elseâs trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Thereâs a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and</p>
<p>actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isnât welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings within the space of a year, we <strong>will terminate your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may terminate</p>
<p>your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use â including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - itâs up to all</p>
<p>of us to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>but we're pi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">king</span> <span style="background-color: red;">up the bandwidth bill each month, so weâd really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post </span>Sound<span style="background-color: red;">cloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p></span>C<span style="background-color: red;">riticize, but do it constructive</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">y</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nly when itâs done constr</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">ctively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Woul</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other peopleâs content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone elseâs name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone elseâs trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Thereâs a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and</p>
<p>actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isnât welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings, we <strong>will suspend your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use â including offensive or defamatory</p>

<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>

<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember â only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">f</span> you<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;">netw o</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e unsure whether you can upload</p>

<p></span>C<span style="background-color: red;">riticize, but do it constructive</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">y</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nly when itâs done constr</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">ctively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Woul</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other peopleâs content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone elseâs name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please donât register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone elseâs trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>Thereâs a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and</p>
<p>actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isnât welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>

<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>

<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>
<p>for any updates.</p>
