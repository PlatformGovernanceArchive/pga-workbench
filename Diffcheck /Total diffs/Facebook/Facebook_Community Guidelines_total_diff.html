<p><strong>Content Code of Conduct</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People</p>
<p>use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos of themselves and their friends, and to</p>
<p>learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of</p>
<p>others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook</p>
<p>and for posting messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are set forth in our</p>
<p>Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THE</p>
<p>USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS</p>
<p>CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE TERMS OF USE MAY RESULT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IN TERMINATION OF YOUR</p>
<p>ACCOUNT AND THE DELETION OF CONTENT THAT YOU HAVE POSTED ON FACEBOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AS</p>
<p>DETERMINED BY FACEBOOK IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. Please refer to our Terms of Use for more information about the</p>
<p>rules applicable to your use of Facebook and the other rights and remedies of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as photographs and videos you</p>
<p>upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you may post and share original photographs and</p>
<p>video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are</p>
<p>original art or animation created by you or your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party</p>
<p>copyrighted content, such as the latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we</p>
<p>expect our users to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>
<p>upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than original works that are created by you</p>
<p>or another user</p>
<p>post or share any Content that infringes upon or violates the copyright, trademarks or other rights of any</p>
<p>third party</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p>
<p>While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of speech simply do</p>
<p>not belong in a community like Facebook. Therefore, you may not post or share Content that:</p>
<p>is obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit</p>
<p>depicts graphic or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone</p>
<p>is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful</p>
<p><strong>Unlawful or Harmful Content or Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Although as an online service provider, we are not responsible for the conduct of our users, we want Facebook to be a</p>
<p>safe place on the internet. Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>
<p>violate any local, state, national or international law or post any Content that would encourage or provide</p>
<p>instructions for a criminal offense</p>
<p>impersonate any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent yourself, your age or your affiliation with any</p>
<p>person or entity</p>
<p>use Facebook to send or make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional</p>
<p>materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation</p>
<p>post or share any personally identifiable or private information of any third party</p>
<p>solicit passwords or personal information from anyone, including those under 18</p>
<p>use information or content you obtained on the Facebook website or service in any manner not authorized by</p>
<p>the Facebook Code of Conduct or Terms of Use</p>
<p>post any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to</p>
<p>interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications</p>
<p>equipment</p>
<p>register for more than one account or use or attempt to use another's account, service or system without</p>
<p>authorization or create a false identity on the Service or the Site</p>
<p>engage in any predatory or stalking conduct</p>
<p>This Content Code of Conduct is subject to change at any time at Facebook's sole discretion.</p><p><h1>20070830163931_vs_20110127224041</h1></p><p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Sign Up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others</p>
<p>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow</p>
<p>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take</p>
<p>threats of suicide very seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we</p>
<p>become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports</p>
<p>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied</p>
<p>or persistently contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make</p>
<p>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or</p>
<p>people you've never met in person can be a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect</p>
<p>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,</p>
<p>institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out</p>
<p>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around</p>
<p>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the</p>
<p>site. Sadistic displays of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual</p>
<p>assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is</p>
<p>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be</p>
<p>mindful of the consequences for you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better</p>
<p>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a</p>
<p>violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real</p>
<p>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to</p>
<p>build trust and safety for everyone. </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">laimi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o b</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> someo</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">e else, crea</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ing multiple</p>
<p>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates</p>
<p>Facebook</span> Co<span style="background-color: red;">de</span><span style="background-color: green;">mmunity</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Standards</p>
<p>Faceb</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">ok</span> <span style="background-color: green;">is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents</p>
<p>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment</p>
<p>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.</p>
<p>When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts</p>
<p>include controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that</p>
<p>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in classrooms.</p>
<p>As a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use</p>
<p>Facebook can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a</p>
<p>global community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p>our terms. Please also refrain from publishing other people's personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing &amp; Spam</strong></p>
<p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to</p>
<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind</p>
<p>that reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>

<p>Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007</p>
<p>Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People</p>
<p>use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos of themselves and their friends, and to</p>
<p>learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of</p>
<p>others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook</p>

<p>Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THE</p>
<p>USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS</p>

<p>third party</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</p>

<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others</p>
<p>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow</p>
<p>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take</p>
<p>threats of suicide very seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we</p>
<p>become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports</p>
<p>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied</p>
<p>or persistently contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make</p>
<p>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or</p>
<p>people you've never met in person can be a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect</p>
<p>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,</p>
<p>institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out</p>
<p>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around</p>
<p>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the</p>
<p>site. Sadistic displays of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual</p>
<p>assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is</p>
<p>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be</p>
<p>mindful of the consequences for you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better</p>
<p>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a</p>
<p>violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real</p>
<p>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to</p>
<p>build trust and safety for everyone. </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">laimi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o b</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> someo</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">e else, crea</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ing multiple</p>

<p>Facebook</span> Co<span style="background-color: red;">de</span><span style="background-color: green;">mmunity</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Standards</p>
<p>Faceb</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">ok</span> <span style="background-color: green;">is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents</p>
<p>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment</p>
<p>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.</p>
<p>When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts</p>
<p>include controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that</p>
<p>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in classrooms.</p>
<p>As a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use</p>
<p>Facebook can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a</p>
<p>global community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p>our terms. Please also refrain from publishing other people's personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing &amp; Spam</strong></p>
<p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to</p>
<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind</p>
<p>that reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>

<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others</p>
<p>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow</p>
<p>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take</p>
<p>threats of suicide very seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we</p>
<p>become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports</p>
<p>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied</p>
<p>or persistently contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make</p>
<p>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or</p>
<p>people you've never met in person can be a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect</p>
<p>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,</p>
<p>institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out</p>
<p>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around</p>
<p>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the</p>
<p>site. Sadistic displays of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual</p>
<p>assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is</p>
<p>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be</p>
<p>mindful of the consequences for you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better</p>
<p>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a</p>
<p>violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real</p>
<p>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to</p>
<p>build trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple</p>
<p>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents</p>
<p>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment</p>
<p>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.</p>
<p>When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts</p>
<p>include controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that</p>
<p>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in classrooms.</p>
<p>As a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use</p>
<p>Facebook can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a</p>
<p>global community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing &amp; Spam</strong></p>
<p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to</p>
<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind</p>
<p>that reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>
<p>Content that does violate our terms may be removed from our site and (in some cases) subject to legal or other</p>
<p>action.</p>

<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take threats of suicide very</p>
<p>seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied or persistently</p>
<p>contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or people you've never met in person can be</p>
<p>a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas, institutions, events, and</p>
<p>practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the site. Sadistic displays</p>
<p>of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be mindful of the consequences for</p>
<p>you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to build trust and safety</p>
<p>for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates our terms. Please also refrain from</p>
<p>publishing other people's personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real</p>
<p>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to</p>
<p>build trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple</p>
<p>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents</p>
<p>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment</p>
<p>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.</p>
<p>When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts</p>
<p>include controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that</p>
<p>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at wor</span>k, <span style="background-color: green;">ple</span><span style="background-color: red;">in c</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">se be sure you have the right to do so.</p>

<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>

<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your</p>
<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your</p>
<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s. Finally, you may not publish other</p>
<p>people's personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>

<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s. Finally, you may not publish other</p>
<p>people's personal information.</p>

<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>

<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>

<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s. Finally, you may not publish other</p>
<p>people's personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>

<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>

<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your</p>
<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>

<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>

<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s terms. Finally, you may not publish</p>
<p>other people's personal information.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>

<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook¹s terms.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>

<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>

<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>

<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>

<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook¹s terms.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p></span><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook¹s terms.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>

<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook¹s terms.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>

<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>

<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.</p>
<p></span>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p>Facebook © 2014 · English (US)</p><p><h1>20140311174113_vs_20140724060702</h1></p><p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity<span style="background-color: red;"> and Pornography</span></strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>

<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>

<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong></p>
<p>It is not permitted to complete transactions involving regulated goods on our</p>

<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.</p>

<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>

<p>consider carefully the audience for that content. If you are using a Page to</p>
<p>connect with your customers and other audiences, you need to abide by our Pages</p>

<p>mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. </p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>

<p>Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the </p>
<p>world more open and connected. Every day, people come to </p>
<p>Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of </p>
<p>others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that </p>
<p>happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more </p>
<p>than one billion people. </p>
<p>We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, </p>
<p>we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. </p>
<p>These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is </p>
<p>allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to </p>
<p>us and removed. Because of the diversity of our global community, </p>
<p>please keep in mind that something that may be disagreeable or </p>
<p>disturbing to you may not violate our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Back to top </p>
<p>Read a letter from our team </p>
<p>Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies </p>
<p>and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make </p>
<p>Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the </p>
<p>world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a </p>
<p>community of more than a billion people around the world. </p>
<p>When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, </p>
<p>communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve </p>
<p>extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and </p>
<p>collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of </p>
<p>things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes </p>
<p>people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of </p>
<p>the community. </p>
<p>That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what </p>
<p>kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community </p>
<p>Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a </p>
<p>place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe </p>
<p>environment for everyone. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we </p>
<p>approach by focusing on a few key principles: </p>
<p>• <strong>Keeping you safe.</strong> We have zero tolerance for any behavior </p>
<p>that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or </p>
<p>advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. </p>
<p>Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook </p>
<p>helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names </p>
<p>and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. </p>
<p>• <strong>Encouraging respectful behavior.</strong> We ask people to consider </p>
<p>their audience when sharing something that may offend </p>
<p>others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see </p>
<p>the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit </p>
<p>sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. </p>
<p>• <strong>Acknowledging cultural diversity.</strong> To ensure our policies </p>
<p>reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and </p>
<p>review input from experts around the world, as well as our </p>
<p>community. Those insights help us understand the context </p>
<p>through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>• <strong>Empowering you with tools to control what you see on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> Facebook is a place for you to connect with the </p>
<p>people and things you care about, so we give you tools to </p>
<p>control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to </p>
<p>people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of </p>
<p>rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to </p>
<p>treat each other with empathy and respect. </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p>We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. Learn more about how </p>
<p>Facebook handles abusive content. </p>
<p><strong>Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by</strong> </p>
<p><strong>others on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify </p>
<p>serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove </p>
<p>credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove </p>
<p>specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. </p>
<p>We may consider things like a person's physical location or public </p>
<p>visibility in determining whether a threat is credible. We may </p>
<p>assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and </p>
<p>unstable regions. </p>
<p><strong>Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>suicide.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work </p>
<p>with organizations around the world to provide assistance for </p>
<p>people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or </p>
<p>encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body </p>
<p>modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that </p>
<p>identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets </p>
<p>them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, </p>
<p>however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does </p>
<p>not promote these things. </p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we</strong> </p>
<p><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following </p>
<p>to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized criminal activity. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment: How we respond to bullying and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>harassment.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak </p>
<p>freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content </p>
<p>that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the </p>
<p>intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but </p>
<p>is not limited to: </p>
<p>• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, </p>
<p>• Images altered to degrade private individuals, </p>
<p>• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the </p>
<p>victim, </p>
<p>• Sharing personal information to blackmail or harass people, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend </p>
<p>requests or messages. </p>
<p>We define private individuals as people who have neither gained </p>
<p>news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions </p>
<p>or public profession. </p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures</strong> </p>
<p><strong>receive on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured </p>
<p>in the news or have a large public audience based on their </p>
<p>profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to </p>
<p>public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we </p>
<p>do for private individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal </p>
<p>activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, </p>
<p>or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. </p>
<p>We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve </p>
<p>committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate </p>
<p>for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a </p>
<p>humorous or satirical way. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and exploitation on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by unauthorized dealers to purchase, sell, </p>
<p>or trade prescription drugs and marijuana. If you post an offer to </p>
<p>purchase or sell firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult products, we </p>
<p>expect you to comply with all applicable laws and carefully consider </p>
<p>the audience for that content. We do not allow you to use </p>
<p>Facebook's payment tools to sell or purchase regulated goods on </p>
<p>our platform. </p>

<p>be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their </p>

In order to treat peop</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">e </span>f<span style="background-color: green;">airly and </p>

<p>blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate </p>
<p>purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this </p>
<p>content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing </p>
<p>in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of </p>
<p>female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow </p>

<p>with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this </p>
<p>content to us. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>

<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, </p>
<p>even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we </p>
<p>urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this </p>
<p>type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>

<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>

<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance</span>, we <span style="background-color: green;">may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>

</span></p><p><h1>20140809091306_vs_20140816020644</h1></p><p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p></span><span style="background-color: red;"> · </span>English (US)</p><p><h1>20141106101310_vs_20141113041918</h1></p><p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, </p>
<p>we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. </p>
<p>These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is </p>
<p>allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to </p>
<p>us and removed. Because of the diversity of our global community, </p>
<p>please keep in mind that something that may be disagreeable or </p>
<p>disturbing to you may not violate our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Back to top </p>
<p>Read a letter from our team </p>
<p>Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies </p>
<p>and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make </p>
<p>Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the </p>
<p>world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a </p>
<p>community of more than a billion people around the world. </p>
<p>When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, </p>
<p>communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve </p>
<p>extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and </p>
<p>collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of </p>
<p>things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes </p>
<p>people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of </p>
<p>the community. </p>
<p>That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what </p>
<p>kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community </p>
<p>Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a </p>
<p>place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe </p>
<p>environment for everyone. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we </p>
<p>approach by focusing on a few key principles: </p>
<p>• <strong>Keeping you safe.</strong> We have zero tolerance for any behavior </p>
<p>that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or </p>
<p>advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. </p>
<p>Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook </p>
<p>helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names </p>
<p>and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. </p>
<p>• <strong>Encouraging respectful behavior.</strong> We ask people to consider </p>
<p>their audience when sharing something that may offend </p>
<p>others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see </p>
<p>the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit </p>
<p>sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. </p>
<p>• <strong>Acknowledging cultural diversity.</strong> To ensure our policies </p>
<p>reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and </p>
<p>review input from experts around the world, as well as our </p>
<p>community. Those insights help us understand the context </p>
<p>through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>• <strong>Empowering you with tools to control what you see on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> Facebook is a place for you to connect with the </p>
<p>people and things you care about, so we give you tools to </p>
<p>control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to </p>
<p>people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of </p>
<p>rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to </p>
<p>treat each other with empathy and respect. </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p>We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. Learn more about how </p>
<p>Facebook handles abusive content. </p>
<p><strong>Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by</strong> </p>
<p><strong>others on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify </p>
<p>serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove </p>
<p>credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove </p>
<p>specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. </p>
<p>We may consider things like a person's physical location or public </p>
<p>visibility in determining whether a threat is credible. We may </p>
<p>assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and </p>
<p>unstable regions. </p>
<p><strong>Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>suicide.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work </p>
<p>with organizations around the world to provide assistance for </p>
<p>people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or </p>
<p>encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body </p>
<p>modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that </p>
<p>identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets </p>
<p>them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, </p>
<p>however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does </p>
<p>not promote these things. </p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we</strong> </p>
<p><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following </p>
<p>to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized criminal activity. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment: How we respond to bullying and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>harassment.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak </p>
<p>freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content </p>
<p>that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the </p>
<p>intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but </p>
<p>is not limited to: </p>
<p>• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, </p>
<p>• Images altered to degrade private individuals, </p>
<p>• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the </p>
<p>victim, </p>
<p>• Sharing personal information to blackmail or harass people, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend </p>
<p>requests or messages. </p>
<p>We define private individuals as people who have neither gained </p>
<p>news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions </p>
<p>or public profession. </p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures</strong> </p>
<p><strong>receive on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured </p>
<p>in the news or have a large public audience based on their </p>
<p>profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to </p>
<p>public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we </p>
<p>do for private individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal </p>
<p>activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, </p>
<p>or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. </p>
<p>We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve </p>
<p>committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate </p>
<p>for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a </p>
<p>humorous or satirical way. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and exploitation on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by unauthorized dealers to purchase, sell, </p>
<p>or trade prescription drugs and marijuana. If you post an offer to </p>
<p>purchase or sell firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult products, we </p>
<p>expect you to comply with all applicable laws and carefully consider </p>
<p>the audience for that content. We do not allow you to use </p>
<p>Facebook's payment tools to sell or purchase regulated goods on </p>
<p>our platform. </p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>People use Facebook to share their experiences and to raise </p>
<p>awareness about issues that are important to them. This means that </p>
<p>you may encounter opinions that are different from yours, which we </p>
<p>believe can lead to important conversations about difficult topics. </p>
<p>To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their </p>
<p>cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and </p>
<p>respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in </p>
<p>place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when </p>
<p>reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more </p>
<p>blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate </p>
<p>purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this </p>
<p>content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing </p>
<p>in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of </p>
<p>female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow </p>
<p>photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing </p>
<p>breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs </p>
<p>of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. </p>
<p>Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also </p>
<p>apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for </p>
<p>educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of </p>
<p>sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go </p>
<p>into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly </p>
<p>attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As </p>
<p>with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this </p>
<p>content to us. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or </p>
<p>educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we </p>
<p>expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, </p>
<p>even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we </p>
<p>urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this </p>
<p>type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people share their </p>
<p>experiences and raise awareness about important issues. </p>
<p>Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and </p>
<p>graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </p>
<p>abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share </p>
<p>this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness </p>
<p>about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for </p>
<p>sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. </p>
<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>
<p>share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that </p>
<p>content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what </p>
<p>they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. </p>

<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help keep your account secure and protect your </p>
<p>personal information. By joining Facebook, you agree to use your </p>
<p>authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal </p>
<p>information of others without their consent. Learn more about how </p>
<p>we work to keep your information safe. </p>
<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real name</strong> </p>
<p><strong>requirement creates a safer environment.</strong> </p>
<p>People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When </p>
<p>people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic </p>
<p>name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we </p>
<p>discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you </p>
<p>to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that </p>
<p>impersonate other people. </p>
<p>If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, </p>
<p>organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, </p>
<p>please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help </p>
<p>you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you </p>
<p>care about. </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>
<p>allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting </p>
<p>them for commercial purposes without their consent. </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away: How</strong> </p>
<p><strong>you can create a place to remember lost loved ones on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook is a place where people come to share their stories and </p>
<p>reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. Once we </p>
<p>receive proof of death, we secure and memorialize accounts. We do </p>
<p>this once we receive sufficient proof of death. Learn more about </p>
<p>what happens when we memorialize an account. </p>
<p>Immediate family members can also request that we remove and </p>
<p>delete a loved one's profile. </p>
<p>Next section </p>
<p>Back to top </p>
<p>Protecting your intellectual property </p>
<p>Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to </p>
<p>you. You own all of the content and information you post on </p>
<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>
<p>on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask </p>
<p>that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal </p>
<p>rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p><p><h1>20150409_vs_20160611</h1></p><p>Community Standards </p>

<p>Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies </p>
<p>and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make </p>
<p>Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the </p>
<p>world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a </p>

<p>visibility in determining whether a threat is credible. We may </p>
<p>assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and </p>
<p>unstable regions. </p>
<p><strong>Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>suicide.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work </p>
<p>with organizations around the world to provide assistance for </p>
<p>people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or </p>
<p>encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body </p>
<p>modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that </p>
<p>identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets </p>
<p>them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, </p>
<p>however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does </p>
<p>not promote these things. </p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we</strong> </p>
<p><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following </p>
<p>to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized criminal activity. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment: How we respond to bullying and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>harassment.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak </p>
<p>freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content </p>
<p>that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the </p>
<p>intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but </p>
<p>is not limited to: </p>
<p>• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, </p>
<p>• Images altered to degrade private individuals, </p>
<p>• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the </p>
<p>victim, </p>
<p>• Sharing personal information to blackmail or harass people, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend </p>
<p>requests or messages. </p>
<p>We define private individuals as people who have neither gained </p>
<p>news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions </p>
<p>or public profession. </p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures</strong> </p>
<p><strong>receive on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured </p>
<p>in the news or have a large public audience based on their </p>
<p>profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to </p>
<p>public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we </p>
<p>do for private individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal </p>
<p>activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, </p>
<p>or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. </p>
<p>We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve </p>
<p>committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate </p>
<p>for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a </p>
<p>humorous or satirical way. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and exploitation on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">unautho</span>ri<span style="background-color: green;">v</span><span style="background-color: red;">zed de</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;"> individual</span>s to purchase, sell, <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>People use Facebook to share their experiences and to raise </p>
<p>awareness about issues that are important to them. This means that </p>
<p>you may encounter opinions that are different from yours, which we </p>
<p>believe can lead to important conversations about difficult topics. </p>
<p>To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their </p>
<p>cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and </p>
<p>respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in </p>
<p>place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when </p>
<p>reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more </p>
<p>blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate </p>
<p>purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this </p>
<p>content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing </p>
<p>in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of </p>
<p>female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow </p>
<p>photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing </p>
<p>breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs </p>
<p>of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. </p>
<p>Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also </p>
<p>apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for </p>
<p>educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of </p>
<p>sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go </p>
<p>into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly </p>
<p>attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As </p>
<p>with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this </p>
<p>content to us. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or </p>
<p>educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we </p>
<p>expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, </p>
<p>even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we </p>
<p>urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this </p>
<p>type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people share their </p>
<p>experiences and raise awareness about important issues. </p>
<p>Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and </p>
<p>graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </p>
<p>abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share </p>
<p>this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness </p>
<p>about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for </p>
<p>sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. </p>
<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>
<p>share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that </p>
<p>content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what </p>
<p>they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help keep your account secure and protect your </p>
<p>personal information. By joining Facebook, you agree to use your </p>
<p>authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal </p>
<p>information of others without their consent. Learn more about how </p>
<p>we work to keep your information safe. </p>
<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> <span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>name</strong> </p>
<p><strong>requirement creates a safer environment.</strong> </p>
<p>People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When </p>
<p>people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic </p>
<p>name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we </p>
<p>discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you </p>
<p>to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that </p>
<p>impersonate other people. </p>
<p>If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, </p>
<p>organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, </p>
<p>please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help </p>
<p>you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you </p>
<p>care about. </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>
<p>allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting </p>
<p>them for commercial purposes without their consent. </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away: How</strong> </p>
<p><strong>you can create a place to remember lost loved ones on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook is a place where people come to share their stories and </p>
<p>reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. Once we </p>
<p>receive proof of death, we secure and memorialize accounts. We do </p>
<p>this once we receive sufficient proof of death. Learn more about </p>
<p>what happens when we memorialize an account. </p>
<p>Immediate family members can also request that we remove and </p>
<p>delete a loved one's profile. </p>

<p>Protecting your intellectual property </p>
<p>Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to </p>
<p>you. You own all of the content and information you post on </p>
<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>
<p>on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask </p>
<p>that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal </p>
<p>rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p><p><h1>20160611_vs_20170708</h1></p><p>Community Standards<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>Read a letter from our team </p>
<p>Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies </p>
<p>and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make </p>
<p>Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the </p>
<p>world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a </p>
<p>community of more than a billion people around the world. </p>
<p>When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, </p>
<p>communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve </p>
<p>extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and </p>
<p>collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of </p>
<p>things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes </p>
<p>people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of </p>
<p>the community. </p>
<p>That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what </p>
<p>kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community </p>
<p>Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a </p>
<p>place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe </p>
<p>environment for everyone. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we </p>
<p>approach by focusing on a few key principles: </p>
<p>• <strong>Keeping you safe.</strong> We have zero tolerance for any behavior </p>
<p>that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or </p>
<p>advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. </p>
<p>Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook </p>
<p>helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names </p>
<p>and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. </p>
<p>• <strong>Encouraging respectful behavior.</strong> We ask people to consider </p>
<p>their audience when sharing something that may offend </p>
<p>others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see </p>
<p>the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit </p>
<p>sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. </p>
<p>• <strong>Acknowledging cultural diversity.</strong> To ensure our policies </p>
<p>reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and </p>
<p>review input from experts around the world, as well as our </p>
<p>community. Those insights help us understand the context </p>
<p>through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>• <strong>Empowering you with tools to control what you see on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> Facebook is a place for you to connect with the </p>
<p>people and things you care about, so we give you tools to </p>
<p>control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to </p>
<p>people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of </p>
<p>rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to </p>
<p>treat each other with empathy and respect. </p>

<p><strong>Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by</strong> </p>
<p><strong>others on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify </p>
<p>serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove </p>
<p>credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove </p>
<p>specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. </p>

<p><strong>Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>suicide.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work </p>
<p>with organizations around the world to provide assistance for </p>
<p>people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or </p>
<p>encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body </p>
<p>modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that </p>
<p>identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets </p>
<p>them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, </p>
<p>however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does </p>
<p>not promote these things. </p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we</strong> </p>
<p><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following </p>
<p>to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>

<p>To help bala</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ce</span> <span style="background-color: red;">the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their </p>
<p>cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and </p>
<p>respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in </p>
<p>place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when </p>
<p>reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more </p>
<p>blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate </p>
<p>purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this </p>
<p>content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing </p>
<p>in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of </p>
<p>female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow </p>
<p>photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing </p>
<p>breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs </p>
<p>of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. </p>
<p>Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also </p>
<p>apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for </p>
<p>educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of </p>
<p>sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go </p>
<p>into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly </p>
<p>attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As </p>
<p>with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this </p>
<p>content to us. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or </p>
<p>educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we </p>
<p>expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, </p>
<p>even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we </p>
<p>urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this </p>
<p>type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people share their </p>
<p>experiences and raise awareness about important issues. </p>
<p>Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and </p>
<p>graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </p>
<p>abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share </p>
<p>this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness </p>
<p>about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for </p>
<p>sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. </p>
<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>
<p>share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that </p>
<p>content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what </p>
<p>they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. </p>

<p>We work hard to help keep your account secure and protect your </p>
<p>personal information. By joining Facebook, you agree to use your </p>
<p>authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal </p>
<p>information of others without their consent. Learn more about how </p>
<p>we work to keep your information safe. </p>
<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real</strong> <strong>name</strong> </p>
<p><strong>requirement creates a safer environment.</strong> </p>
<p>People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When </p>
<p>people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic </p>
<p>name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we </p>
<p>discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you </p>
<p>to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that </p>
<p>impersonate other people. </p>
<p>If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, </p>
<p>organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, </p>
<p>please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help </p>
<p>you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you </p>
<p>care about. </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>
<p>allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting </p>
<p>them for commercial purposes without their consent. </p>

<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>

<p>ammunition. </span>F<span style="background-color: green;">irearm shops and online retailers may promote </p>

<p>be</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ieve can lead to important conversations about difficult topics. </p>
<p>To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Adult Nudity &amp; Sexual Activity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly </p>
<p>because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people </p>
<p>fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have </p>
<p>policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily </p>
<p>when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be </p>
<p>more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for </p>
<p>legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at </p>
<p>evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in </p>
<p>on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female </p>
<p>breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that </p>
<p>are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of </p>
<p>women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with </p>
<p>post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, </p>
<p>sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the </p>
<p>display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless </p>
<p>the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of </p>
<p>sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that </p>
<p>directly attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>

<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook</span>. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness </p>
<p>or educating others about that hate speech. </span>W<span style="background-color: red;">e do </p>
<p>t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">is onc</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> we receive sufficie</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">t</span> <span style="background-color: red;">proof of dea</span>th<span style="background-color: green;">is is the case, </p>
<p>we expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content</span>. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is particularly </p>
<p>cruel or insensitive, even if that content does not violate our </p>
<p>policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their </p>
<p>audience when sharing this type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. </span>Learn more about <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">You</span> <span style="background-color: green;">can also use Facebook to </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people share their </p>
<p>experiences and raise awareness about important issues. </p>
<p>Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and </p>
<p>graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </p>
<p>abuses or acts of terrorism. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">mmediate family members ca</span>n <span style="background-color: red;">also request that we re</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ove </span>an<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may </p>

<p>personal information. By joining</span> Facebook, <span style="background-color: green;">you agree to use your </p>
<p>authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal </p>
<p>information of others without their consent. Learn more about how </p>
<p>we work to keep your information safe. </p>
<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s authentic</strong> </p>
<p><strong>identity policy creates a safer environment.</strong> </p>
<p>People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When </p>
<p>people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic </p>
<p>name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we </p>
<p>discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you </p>
<p>to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that </p>
<p>impersonate other people. </p>
<p>If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, </p>
<p>organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, </p>
<p>please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can </p>
<p>help you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause </p>
<p>you care about. </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>
<p>allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting </p>
<p>them for commercial purposes without their consent. </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>What happens to your account when you pass away?</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook is a place where people can come to share their stories </p>
<p>and reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. </p>
<p>Once we become aware that a person has passed away, we secure </p>
<p>and memorialize accounts. We do this once we receive sufficient </p>
<p>proof of death. Let us know if you want a loved one to manage your </p>
<p>account after you are gone and learn more about what happens </p>
<p>when we memorialize an account. </p>
<p>Immediate family members can also request that we remove and </p>
<p>delete a loved one's profile. </p>

<p>Protecting your intellectual property </p>
<p>Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to </p>
<p>you. You own all of the content and information you post on </p>
<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>
<p>on Facebook, </span>please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask </p>
<p>that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal </p>
<p>rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p><p><h1>20170708_vs_20180430</h1></p><p><span style="background-color: red;">Community Standards </p>
<p>Our mission is to give people the power to build community and </p>
<p>bring the world closer together. Every day, people come to </p>
<p>Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of </p>
<p>others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that </p>
<p>happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more </p>
<p>than two billion people. </p>
<p>We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, </p>
<p>we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. </p>
<p>These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is </p>
<p>allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to </p>
<p>us and removed. Sometimes we will allow content if newsworthy, </p>
<p>significant or important to the public interest – even if it might </p>
<p>otherwise violate our standards. Because of the diversity of our </p>
<p>global community, please keep in mind that something that may be </p>
<p>disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community </p>
<p>Standards. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>
<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on F</span>acebook.<span style="background-color: green;"> We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Bullying policy violations </p>

<p>acting/pretending to be a victim of a verified event, or otherwise is paid or </p>
<p>employed to mislead people about their role in the event when sent directly to </p>
<p>a survivor and/or immediate family member of a survivor or victim </p>
<p>Send messages to a group that contain any bullying policy violations, regardless of </p>
<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>
<p>exploitation </p>
<p>Threatening any participant in public discourse with violence in an attempt to </p>
<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Target victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by image, with claims that </p>
<p>they are </p>
<p>Lying about being a victim of an event </p>
<p>Acting/pretending to be a victim of an event </p>
<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the event </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in </p>
<p>the following to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized violence or criminal activity, </p>
<p>• Mass or serial murderers, or </p>
<p>• Organized hate groups. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment:</strong> <strong>How we respond to bullying and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>harassment.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak </p>
<p>freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content </p>
<p>that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the </p>
<p>intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but </p>
<p>is not limited to: </p>
<p>• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, </p>
<p>• Images altered to degrade private individuals, </p>
<p>• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the </p>
<p>victim, and </p>
<p>• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend </p>
<p>requests or messages. </p>
<p>We define private individuals as people who have neither gained </p>
<p>news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions </p>
<p>or public profession. </p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures</strong> </p>
<p><strong>receive on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured </p>
<p>in the news or have a large public audience based on their </p>
<p>profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to </p>
<p>public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we </p>
<p>do for private individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal </p>
<p>activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, </p>
<p>or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. </p>
<p>We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve </p>
<p>committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate </p>
<p>for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a </p>
<p>humorous or satirical way. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and exploitation on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or </p>
<p>trade prescription drugs, marijuana, firearms or ammunition. We </p>
<p>don't permit the individual purchase, sale or trade of firearms or </p>
<p>ammunition. Firearm shops and online retailers may promote </p>
<p>commercial activity (ex: discussing a gun for sale at their store </p>
<p>location) only if they comply with all applicable laws and regulations. </p>
<p>We do not allow you to use Facebook's payment tools to sell or </p>
<p>purchase regulated goods on our platform. </p>

<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly </p>
<p>because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people </p>
<p>fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have </p>
<p>policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily </p>
<p>when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be </p>
<p>more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for </p>
<p>legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at </p>
<p>evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in </p>
<p>on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female </p>
<p>breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that </p>
<p>are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of </p>
<p>women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with </p>
<p>post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, </p>
<p>sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the </p>
<p>display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless </p>
<p>the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of </p>
<p>sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that </p>
<p>directly attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness </p>
<p>or educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, </p>
<p>we expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is particularly </p>
<p>cruel or insensitive, even if that content does not violate our </p>
<p>policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their </p>
<p>audience when sharing this type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>

<p>about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for </p>
<p>sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. </p>
<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>
<p>share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that </p>
<p>content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what </p>
<p>they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. With that said, </p>
<p>there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may </p>
<p>be disturbing and we add a warning screen to it so that people are </p>
<p>aware before they see it. </p>

<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>

<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away:</strong> </p>

<p>Facebook is a place where people can come to share their stories </p>

<p>Once we become aware that a person has passed away, we secure </p>
<p>and memorialize accounts. We do this once we receive sufficient </p>
<p>proof of death. Let us know if you want a loved one to manage your </p>
<p>account after you are gone and learn more about what happens </p>
<p>when we memorialize an account. </p>

<p>you. You own all of the content and information you post on </p>
<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>

<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>

<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>

<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p></span>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>

<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character<span style="background-color: green;"> claims </p>
<p>Negative ability</span> claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims</span> </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>

<p>subtracting the new content added in July 2019 leaves this excerpt truncated. </p>
<p>Therefore, the expression “makes fun of” was added by us as attempt to reconstruct </p>
<p>what was the likely meaning of the text before July 2019. </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our profiles product by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>

<p></span><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Negative ability claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>
<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>

<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>

<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>

<p><strong>16. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>

<p><strong>17.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></strong><strong></span>Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>

<p>Misuse our profiles product by </p>

<p></span><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV: Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Negative ability claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>

<p></span><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>

<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>

<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Target victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by image, with claims that </p>

<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the event </p>

<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>

<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character<span style="background-color: red;"> claims </p>
<p>Negative ability</span> claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>

<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">C</span><span style="background-color: green;">Targeted c</span>ursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual </p>
<p>orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also </p>
<p>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or </p>
<p>segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>

<p><strong>16. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>

<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>

<p>Creating another account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>

<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>
<p>under the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>
<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Targeted cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Bullying policy violations </p>

<p>acting/pretending to be a victim of a verified event, or otherwise is paid or </p>
<p>employed to mislead people about their role in the event when sent directly to </p>
<p>a survivor and/or immediate family member of a survivor or victim </p>
<p>Send messages to a group that contain any bullying policy violations, regardless of </p>
<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>
<p>exploitation </p>
<p>Threatening any participant in public discourse with violence in an attempt to </p>
<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Target victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by image, with claims that </p>
<p>they are </p>
<p>Lying about being a victim of an event </p>
<p>Acting/pretending to be a victim of an event </p>
<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the event </p>
<p>Target a minor who is a public figure with:15 </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity or sexually transmitted disease(s) </p>
<p>Content has been photoshopped to include threats of violence either in text or </p>

<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence or low severity harm in an attempt to </p>
<p>silence someone </p>
<p>Objects created to attack through: </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual </p>
<p>orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also </p>
<p>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or </p>
<p>segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>

<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>

<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>

<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>

<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>

<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our profiles product by </p>

<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">19</span><span style="background-color: green;">20</span>. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process.<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>A<span style="background-color: green;">ttacks through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. whore, slut) </p>
<p>A</span>n individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>

<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual </p>
<p>orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also </p>
<p>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or </p>
<p>segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>
<p>Charred or burning people <span style="background-color: green;">unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </span></p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Videos that show child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities including but </p>
<p>not limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that engages in explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the </p>
<p>following, offering or asking for: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that engages in implicit sexual solicitation, which can be identified by </p>
<p>mentioning a sexual act and other suggestive elements such as any of the following:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” </p>
<p>Sexualized slang </p>
<p>Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish </p>
<p>scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act </p>
<p>of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), </p>
<p>commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or </p>
<p>buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks </p>
<p>Content (hand drawn, digital, or real-world art) that may depict explicit sexual </p>
<p>activity or suggestively posed person(s) </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that offers or asks for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Partners who share fetish or sexual interests </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or </p>

<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and [makes fun of] of their implied or premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual touching, or </p>
<p>serious physical injury </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable </p>

<p>Promise non-existent Facebook features </p>
<p><strong>18. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our profiles product by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p>Engage in inauthentic behavior, which includes creating, managing, or otherwise </p>
<p>perpetuating </p>
<p>Accounts that are fake </p>
<p>Accounts that have fake names </p>
<p>Accounts that participate, , or claim to engage in in coordinated inauthentic </p>

<p>the following: </p>
<p>Mislead people about the origin of content </p>
<p>Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for </p>
<p>example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination </p>
<p>URL) </p>
<p>Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks </p>
<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>
<p>under the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>19. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>20. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>Attacks through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. whore, slut) </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>

<p></span><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Targeted cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Bullying policy violations </p>
<p>Claims that a victim of a violent tragedy is lying about being a victim, </p>
<p>acting/pretending to be a victim of a verified event, or otherwise is paid or </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual </p>
<p>orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also </p>
<p>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or </p>
<p>segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Videos that show child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not </p>

<p></span><strong>19. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>20. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk withto experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our </p>
<p>policies and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we </p>
<p>should not remove live videos of self-harm while there is an opportunity for loved </p>
<p>ones and authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically.   </p>

<p><strong>II<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>Attacks through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. whore, slut) </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>
<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Targeted cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>

<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, <span style="background-color: red;">caste </span>sexual </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">also </span>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, <span style="background-color: green;">or</span><span style="background-color: red;">and</span> calls for exclusion or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>20. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence (unless the target is an organization or </p>

<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence (unless the target is an </p>

<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>(unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous </p>
<p>Individuals and Organizations policy) </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, vulnerable persons, or vulnerable groups where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence (unless the target is an adult public figure </p>
<p>convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous </p>
<p>organization); or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence (unless the target is a member of a dangerous </p>

<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that</span>'s <span style="background-color: red;">character to posting inappropriate i</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ag</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s to </p>

<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p></span>Facebook <span style="background-color: green;">to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hu</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;">ecause</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">e want t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">ich</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">n cer</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ain</span> <span style="background-color: red;">instances, we </p>

<p>Our bullying policie</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>III.<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong></span>Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>

<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it.</span> </p>
<p>Do not post:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation which we define as offering or requesting things, including </p>
<p>but not limited to the following: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p>Implicit sexual solicitation, which we define as an offer or request to engage paired </p>
<p>with at least one of the following elements, none of which violate our Community </p>
<p>Standards on their own: </p>
<p>Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” </p>
<p>Sexualized slang </p>
<p>Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish </p>
<p>scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act </p>
<p>of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), </p>
<p>commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or </p>
<p>buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks </p>
<p>An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Partners who share fetish or sexual interests </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or </p>
<p>mentioning of: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>IV:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>

<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our profiles product by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>

<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>

<p>Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for </p>
<p>example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination </p>

<p>Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks </p>
<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>

<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>,</span>When <span style="background-color: green;">someone passes a</span>w<span style="background-color: red;">e le</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">rn</span><span style="background-color: green;">y,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">fri</span><span style="background-color: red;">that som</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">o</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">e has passe</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">s</span> a<span style="background-color: green;">nd family can request </p>
<p>that </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">ay, w</span>e memorialize the account by <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>adding "Remembering" above the name on the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>person's profile. This makes it clear <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that the account is now a memorial site and <span style="background-color: red;">protects against attempted logins and </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">protects against attempted logins and </span>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>or change anything about the profile <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>or the account because we want to respect the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>choices someone made while still <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>alive. We have also made it possible for people to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>identify a legacy contact to look <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>after their account after they pass away. People can <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>let us know in advance if they <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>want their account permanently deleted when they die. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We may delete profiles when <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>would have preferred that we <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>delete the account rather than memorialize it. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong></span>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self<span style="background-color: green;"> injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self</span>-injury <span style="background-color: green;">or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">9. </span>Bullying and Harassment</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Attacking them through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. </p>
<p>whore, slut) </p>
<p>Posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that </p>
<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>
<p>Posting content about victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by </p>
<p>image, with claims that they are </p>
<p>Acting/pretending to be a victim of an event </p>
<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”)<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics<span style="background-color: green;">, where exclusion is defined as: </p>
<p>Explicit Exclusion which includes but is not limited to "expel" or "not allowed"</span>. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Political Exclusion defined as denial of right to political participation. </p>
<p>Economic Exclusion defined as denial of access to economic entitlements and </p>
<p>limiting participation in the labour market, </p>
<p>Social Exclusion defined as including but not limited to denial of opportunity to </p>
<p>gain access to spaces (incl. online) and social services. </p>
<p></span>We do allow criticism of immigration <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>policies and arguments for restricting those <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence (<span style="background-color: red;">unless the target is an organization or </p>
<p>individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, or is </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact <span style="background-color: red;">a </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">ingle pers</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">n d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">spite that pers</span>on<span style="background-color: green;">e in a manner than is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>

<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Attacking them through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. </p>

<p>Posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that </p>
<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>
<p>Posting content about victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by </p>

<p></span><strong>11. Hate Speech</strong><span style="background-color: red;"> </span> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>

<p>is depicted in an image </p>

<p><strong>For more information on the refinements we made to Tier 2 of our hate speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>policies, read through the</strong> <strong>notes from the meeting</strong> <strong>where the policy proposal</strong> </p>
<p><strong>was discussed and adopted.</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics, where exclusion is defined as: </p>
<p>Explicit Exclusion which includes but is not limited to "expel" or "not allowed". </p>
<p>Political Exclusion defined as denial of right to political participation. </p>
<p>Economic Exclusion defined as denial of access to economic entitlements and </p>
<p>limiting participation in the labour market, </p>
<p>Social Exclusion defined as including but not limited to denial of opportunity to </p>
<p>gain access to spaces (incl. online) and social services. </p>
<p>We do allow criticism of immigration policies and arguments for restricting those </p>
<p>policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>12. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Videos or photos that depict non-sexual child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>
<p>Imagery featuring mutilated people if it contains the following in a medical setting </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people, including cremation or self-immolation when that </p>
<p>action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Photos of wounded or dead people if they show </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Imagery featuring animals that shows </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>
<p>Charred or burning animals </p>
<p>Animal abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking or beating of an animal by a person </p>
<p>Acts of torture by a person committed against animals </p>
<p>Biting of an animal for abusive purposes </p>
<p>Imagery of animal fights when visible innards or dismemberment is visible, </p>
<p>unless in the wild </p>

<p>or food preparation/processing context </p>

<p><strong>14. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that meets both of the following criteria:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly (typically through providing a method of <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>contact) <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>offers or asks for: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>following <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Content that mentions or depicts hints of sexual activity such as: <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sexual <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>of sexual <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Including content (hand drawn, digital, or real world art) that <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>depicts <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>sexual activity (explicit or implicit), or </p>
<p>Including imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>human <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>parts, objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>of fully nude <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>butts<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Nude images, unless modeling context is clear </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) </p>

<p><strong>15. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>

<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p><strong>16. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Promise non-existent Facebook features </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p>Engage in inauthentic behavior, which includes creating, managing, or otherwise </p>
<p>perpetuating </p>
<p>Accounts that are fake </p>
<p>Accounts that have fake names </p>
<p>Accounts that participate in, or claim to engage in, coordinated inauthentic </p>
<p>behavior, meaning that multiple accounts are working together to do any of </p>
<p>the following: </p>
<p>Mislead people about the origin of content </p>
<p>Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for </p>
<p>example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination </p>
<p>URL) </p>
<p>Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks </p>
<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>
<p>under the Community Standards </p>
<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p></span><strong>20. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence <span style="background-color: green;">including content where no target is specified </p>

<p><strong>2. Dangerous Individuals and Organizations</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow any organizations </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>

<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>

<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Participation by yourself or others to engage in any form of the above </p>
<p>mentioned sexual acts. </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing imagery that fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, media coverage or law </p>
<p>enforcement record) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Secretly taken imagery of <span style="background-color: red;"> </span>a real person's commonly sexualized body <span style="background-color: red;"> </span>(such <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>as <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the breasts, groin, or buttocks) or of a real person engaged in sexual <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>activity. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" or "upskirts" <span style="background-color: green;">and includes </p>
<p>photos or videos</span>:<span style="background-color: red;">and</span> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">includes photos or videos:</span> </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share intimate imagery without </p>
<p>consent </p>
<p>Soliciting intimate imagery to view or share without consent </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment<span style="background-color: green;"> (2</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>nd</strong></span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>version July 2019)</strong> </span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner than is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p></span><strong>11. Hate Speech<span style="background-color: green;"> (2</strong><strong>nd</strong> <strong>version July 2019)</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>12. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Videos or photos that depict non-sexual child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>

<p>Sexual activity, including </p>
<p>Sexual intercourse </p>

<p>entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, </p>

<p>sexual health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional </p>
<p>images or with indicators of fiction </p>
<p>Implied stimulation of genitalia/anus, defined as stimulating </p>
<p>genitalia/anus or inserting objects into genitalia/anus, even when </p>
<p>the activity is not directly visible, except in cases of sexual </p>

<p><strong>14. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly (typically through providing a method of contact) </p>
<p>offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the following </p>
<p>sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Content that mentions or depicts hints of sexual activity such as: sexual </p>
<p>roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual </p>
<p>intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Including content (hand drawn, digital, or real world art) that depicts </p>
<p>sexual activity (explicit or implicit), or </p>
<p>Including imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human </p>
<p>parts, objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Nude images, unless modeling context is clear </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse </p>
<p><strong>15. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>16. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Promise non-existent Facebook features </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>

<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>

<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale<span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>

<p>represent violence; or </p>

<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>

<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>

<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,<span style="background-color: green;">or forced stripping,</span> including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>

<p>Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people by </p>
<p>threats of exposure of their intimate imagery or intimate information </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment<span style="background-color: red;"> (2</strong><strong>nd</strong> <strong>version July 2019)</span></strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner than is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>

<p>pleasure </p>

<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>

<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>

<p><strong>14. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<span style="background-color: green;"><strong>*</strong></span> (typically through providing a method of <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>contact) <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>offers or asks for: </p>

<p></span>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>following <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p></span>intercourse or <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>

<p>butts </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for <span style="background-color: red;">other adult activities such as: </p>

<p>fetish scenarios)</span> </p>
<p><strong>15. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>

<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>

<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>

<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and <span style="background-color: green;">the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other </span>v<span style="background-color: red;">u</span><span style="background-color: green;">io</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">nt </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ctors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to </span>b<span style="background-color: green;">e k</span>il<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;">led), and we deem </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">hose non </p>

<p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt harmful or fraudulent activity, we remove content </p>
<p>aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive </p>

<p>awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities using our </p>

<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the following </p>
<p>activities: </p>

<p><strong>7</span>. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people by </p>
<p>threats of exposure of their intimate imagery or intimate information </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery </p>
<p>known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that fulfills all </p>
<p>three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>

<p></span>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that </p>

<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">9</span><span style="background-color: green;">10</span>. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>

<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>

<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Videos or photos that depict non-sexual child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>

<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>

<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </span>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">2</span>1<span style="background-color: red;">9</span>. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>
<p>mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election. </p>
<p>Misinformation that contributes to imminent violence or physical harm. </p>
<p>Calls to action, statements of intent to bring armaments to locations, including but </p>

<p><strong>7. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>9.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people by </p>
<p>threats of exposure of their intimate imagery or intimate information </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery </p>
<p>known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that fulfills all </p>
<p>three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that </p>
<p>meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>10. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>

<p>condemning caption </p>
<p><strong>11. Human Exploitation<span style="background-color: red;"> (New)</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>

<p><strong>13. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>14. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>

<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Videos or photos that depict non-sexual child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>

<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>
<p>Imagery featuring mutilated people if it contains the following in a medical setting </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>

<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>

<p>Acts of torture by a person committed against animals </p>

<p>may be sensitive: </p>

<p>Sexual activity, including </p>
<p>Sexual intercourse </p>
<p>Explicit sexual intercourse, defined as mouth or genitals entering </p>
<p>or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at </p>
<p>least one person's genitals are nude </p>
<p>Implied sexual intercourse, defined as mouth or genitals </p>
<p>entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, </p>
<p>even when the contact is not directly visible, except in cases of a </p>
<p>sexual health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional </p>
<p>images or with indicators of fiction </p>
<p>Implied stimulation of genitalia/anus, defined as stimulating </p>
<p>genitalia/anus or inserting objects into genitalia/anus, even when </p>

<p></span><strong>16. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>

<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. <span style="background-color: green;">We also remove any form of </p>
<p>sadism towards people or animals. </span></p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>

<p><strong>23. <span style="background-color: green;">Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people by </p>
<p>threats of exposure of their intimate imagery or intimate information </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery </p>
<p>known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that fulfills all </p>
<p>three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that </p>
<p>meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">9</span><span style="background-color: red;">10</span>. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Do not: </p>
<p></span>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>

<p><strong>13</span>. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>
<p>Content targeting a person or group of people (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>
<p>Violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, </p>
<p>or unqualified behavioral statements to or about: </p>

<p>Derogatory terms related to sexual activity, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: whore, slut, perverts </p>
<p>Other statements of inferiority, which we define as: </p>
<p>Expressions about being less than adequate, including but not limited </p>
<p>to: worthless, useless </p>
<p>Expressions about being better/worse than another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, including but not limited to: "I believe that males are </p>
<p>superior to females." </p>
<p>Expressions about deviating from the norm, including but not limited to: </p>
<p>freaks, abnormal </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, which we define as: </p>

<p>Expressions that a protected characteristic shouldn't exist </p>

<p>limiting participation in the labour market, </p>
<p>Social Exclusion defined as including but not limited to denial of opportunity to </p>

<p>We do allow criticism of immigration policies and arguments for restricting those </p>

<p>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>1<span style="background-color: red;">4</span><span style="background-color: green;">3</span>. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. We also remove any form of </p>
<p>sadism towards people or animals. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>

<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>
<p>mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election </p>

<p>Mass and multiple murderers (including attempts) </p>
<p>We consider a homicide to be a mass murder if it results in three or more </p>
<p>deaths in one incident </p>

<p>weapon or vehicle to attempt mass harm in a public space or against more </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>

<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>

<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>

<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>II<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Safety</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>
<p>Content targeting a person or group of people (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. <span style="background-color: red;">We</span> <span style="background-color: red;">als</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>

<p></span><strong>22. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span></p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>we memorialize <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>person's profile. This <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and <span style="background-color: red;">protects against </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">protects against </span>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, <span style="background-color: red;">or change </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or change </span>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the <span style="background-color: red;">choices </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">choices </span>someone made while alive. We have also made it possible for people to <span style="background-color: red;">identify </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">identify </span>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can <span style="background-color: red;">let us </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">let us </span>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>would <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>

<p><strong>23. Intellectual property</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>24. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><strong>25. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p><p><h1>20191230_vs_20200130</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. <span style="background-color: green;">Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </span></p>
<p>Do not: </p>

<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>

<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>

<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Attacking them through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>II<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p></span><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>
<p>Violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, </p>

<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their <span style="background-color: red;"> </span>premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Media,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. </span>W<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">n</span> <span style="background-color: red;">someone p</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">im</span><span style="background-color: red;">sses</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to remove this c</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">tegory of manipulated media </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">ay, fri</span>en<span style="background-color: red;">ds</span> <span style="background-color: green;">th</span><span style="background-color: red;">and family can r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p></span>qu<span style="background-color: red;">est th</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">li</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">y,</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>protects against attempted logins and fra</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">dulent activity. We do not remove, update, </p>
<p>or change anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the </p>
<p>choices someone made while alive. We have also made it possible for people to </p>
<p>identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can </p>
<p>let us know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. </p>
<p>We may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed </p>
<p>would have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>
<p>mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election </p>
<p>Misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. </p>
<p>Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional </p>
<p>statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of </p>

<p>same.) </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>

<p></span><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by posting or soliciting personally identifiable </p>

<p></span><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>

<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>

<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p>Sexual activity, including </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>

<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>

<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media<span style="background-color: red;"> (New)</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>it<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>clear</span> that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins <span style="background-color: red;">and </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and </span>fraudulent activity. To<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. <span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>

<p><strong>V<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>
<p>mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election </p>
<p>Misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. </p>
<p>Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional </p>
<p>statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of </p>

<p>same.) </p>

<p>Mass and multiple murderers (including attempts) </p>
<p>We consider a homicide to be a mass murder if it results in three or more </p>
<p>deaths in one incident </p>
<p>We consider an attempted mass murder to be one where an individual uses a </p>
<p>weapon or vehicle to attempt mass harm in a public space or against more </p>
<p>than one person </p>
<p>We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over </p>
<p>multiple incidents or locations a multiple murderer </p>

<p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt harmful or fraudulent activity, we remove content </p>
<p>aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive </p>
<p>another of money, property, or legal right. However, we allow people to raise </p>
<p>awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities using our </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>
<p>Self-harm </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, andWe </span>also provide <span style="background-color: green;">certain </span>some protections for immigration status. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We define attack as violent or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>calls for exclusion or segregation. <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>

<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>

<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Statements denying existence </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>

<p>characteristic, including but not limited to: "I believe that males are </p>

<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>

<p>dismemberment of non-regenerating body, unless in the wild </p>

<p></span><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>

<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>

<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><strong>24. Intellectual property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p><p><h1>20200330_vs_20200430</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Any content created for the express purpose of outing an individual as a member of </p>
<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>
<p>mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election </p>
<p>Misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. </p>
<p>Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional </p>
<p>statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of </p>
<p>worship,educational facilities or polling places ( or encouraging others to do the </p>
<p>same.)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>Mass and multiple murderers (including attempts) </p>
<p>We consider a homicide to be a mass murder if it results in three or more </p>
<p>deaths in one incident </p>
<p>We consider an attempted mass murder to be one where an individual uses a </p>
<p>weapon or vehicle to attempt mass harm in a public space or against more </p>

<p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm and copycat behavior, we prohibit </p>
<p>people from facilitating, organizing, promoting, or admitting to certain criminal or </p>
<p>harmful activities targeted at people, businesses, property or animals. We allow </p>
<p>people to debate and advocate for the legality of criminal and harmful activities, as </p>

<p></span><strong>5. Fraud and Deception</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt harmful or fraudulent activity, we remove content </p>
<p>aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive </p>
<p>another of money, property, or legal right. However, we allow people to raise </p>
<p>awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities using our </p>
<p>platform. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the following </p>
<p>activities: </p>
<p>Offering, solicitation and trade of: </p>
<p>Goods/property purchased with stolen financial information </p>
<p>Future exam papers or answer sheets where answers are not meant to </p>
<p>be widely shared </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>
<p>Self-harm </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by posting or soliciting personally identifiable </p>
<p>information, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>National identification numbers, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, </p>
<p>or exam numbers </p>

<p>School and education IDs featuring two of the following: (1) name, (2) photo, </p>
<p>or (3) ID number </p>
<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>Content that contains medical/psychological, biometric, or genetic records or official </p>
<p>documentationof others </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing personally identifiable information via </p>
<p>an external link </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing private financial information of an </p>
<p>organization or business </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by disclosing the following personal financial </p>
<p>information (of either the self or others) </p>
<p>Bank account and/or card information </p>
<p>Financial records paired with account information </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing the private contact information of </p>
<p>others defined as </p>
<p>Private phone numbers or addresses </p>
<p>Email, Messenger, and chat identities </p>
<p>The above information may be shared to promote charitable causes, non-</p>
<p>violating services, or to facilitate finding missing people or animals </p>
<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>
<p>Content that identifies individuals by name and depicts their personal information, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>Driver’s licenses, Government IDs other than driver’s licenses, Green Cards, </p>
<p>or immigration papers </p>
<p>Marriage, birth, and name change certificates </p>
<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>License plates </p>
<p>Content that includes photographs that display the external view of private </p>
<p>residences if the following conditions apply: </p>
<p>The residence is a single-family home, or the resident’s unit number is </p>
<p>identified in the image/caption </p>
<p>The city or neighborhood is identified </p>
<p>A resident is mentioned or depicted </p>
<p>That same resident objects to the exposure of their private residence </p>
<p>Content that exposes the undercover status of law enforcement personnel if </p>
<p>The content contains the agent’s full name or other explicit identification and </p>
<p>explicitly mentions their undercover status, or </p>
<p>The content contains images identifying the faces of the law enforcement </p>
<p>personnel and explicitly mentions their undercover status </p>
<p>Content that exposes information about safe houses by sharing any of the below, </p>
<p>unless the safe house is actively promoting its location, contact information, or the </p>
<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>
<p>Identifiable city/neighborhood of the safe house, or </p>
<p>Information outing residents of the safe house </p>
<p>The following content also may be removed </p>
<p>A reported photo or video of people where the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>is: </p>
<p>A minor under thirteen years old, and the content was reported by the </p>
<p>minor or a parent or legal guardian, </p>
<p>A minor between thirteen and eighteen years old, and the content was </p>
<p>reported by the minor, </p>
<p>An adult, where the content was reported by the adult from outside the </p>
<p>United States and applicable law may provide rights to removal </p>
<p>Any person who is incapacitated and unable to report the content on </p>
<p>their own </p>
<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, andWe also provide certain some protections for immigration status. </p>
<p>We define attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or </p>
<p>calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as </p>
<p>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>
<p>Content targeting a person or group of people (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>
<p>Violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, </p>

<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Statements denying existence </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>Derogatory terms related to sexual activity, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: whore, slut, perverts </p>

<p>characteristic, including but not limited to: "I believe that males are </p>

<p>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p></span><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos, videos or imagery </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>

<p></span><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>

<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>

<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>

<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Attacking them through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. </p>
<p>whore, slut) </p>

<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>
<p>Posting content about victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>

<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>

<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>

<p>A reported photo or video of people where the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>is: </p>
<p>A minor under thirteen years old, and the content was reported by the </p>
<p>minor or a parent or legal guardian, </p>
<p>A minor between thirteen and eighteen years old, and the content was </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, andWe also provide certain some protections for immigration status. </p>
<p>We define attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or </p>
<p>calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as </p>
<p>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p>Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos<span style="background-color: green;">/</span><span style="background-color: red;">, </span>videos<span style="background-color: green;">/</span><span style="background-color: red;"> or </span>imagery </p>
<p>Content that <span style="background-color: green;">is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p></span>meets both of the following criteria<span style="background-color: green;">. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating</span>: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating.</span> </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies<span style="background-color: green;">(not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram)</span> </p>

<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) <span style="background-color: red;">of any </p>
<p></span>target<span style="background-color: green;">ing </p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault, sexual </p>
<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Attacking them through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. </p>

<p>Posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that </p>
<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>
<p>Posting content about victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>

<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and<span style="background-color: green;"> also provide certain protections for immigration status. </span>We <span style="background-color: red;">also</span><span style="background-color: green;">define</span> <span style="background-color: red;">pro</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>attack as </span>vi<span style="background-color: red;">de certain some protections for immigration status. </p>
<p>We define attack as vi</span>olent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>calls for <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as </p>
<p>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>

<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p><p><h1>20200630_vs_20200730</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private </p>
<p>individuals, unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or </p>
<p>high risk groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Content</span> that exposes the identity or locations affiliated with any individual who is <span style="background-color: red;">alleged to </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">alleged to </span>be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share <span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>

<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>
<p>Any content containing statements of intent, calls for action, or advocating for high or </p>

<p>violence or physical harm. </p>
<p>Statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional </p>
<p>statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of </p>

<p>same). </p>

<p>to death, serious injury or serious harm to civilians </p>
<p>With the intent to coerce, intimidate and/or influence a civilian </p>
<p>population, government, or international organization </p>
<p>In order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological aim. </p>
<p>Hate organizations and their leaders and prominent members </p>
<p>A hate organization is defined as: </p>
<p>Any association of three or more people that is organized under a </p>

<p>Mass and multiple murderers (including attempts) </p>
<p>We consider a homicide to be a mass murder if it results in three or more </p>
<p>deaths in one incident </p>
<p>We consider an attempted mass murder to be one where an individual uses a </p>
<p>weapon or vehicle to attempt mass harm in a public space or against more </p>

<p>activities: </p>
<p>Offering, solicitation and trade of: </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;"> and</span> real-time </p>
<p>depictions <span style="background-color: green;">and fictional content </span>that experts tell us might lead others to engage in <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>similar behavior. Self-<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>body, including self-<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>space where people can <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>share their experiences, raise awareness about these <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>issues, and seek support from <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">-</span>injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources.<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by posting or soliciting personally identifiable </p>

<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>Content that contains medical/psychological, biometric, or genetic records or official </p>
<p>documentationof others </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing personally identifiable information via </p>
<p>an external link </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing private financial information of an </p>
<p>organization or business </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by disclosing the following personal financial </p>
<p>information (of either the self or others) </p>
<p>Bank account and/or card information </p>
<p>Financial records paired with account information </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing the private contact information of </p>
<p>others defined as </p>
<p>Private phone numbers or addresses </p>
<p>Email, Messenger, and chat identities </p>
<p>The above information may be shared to promote charitable causes, non-</p>
<p>violating services, or to facilitate finding missing people or animals </p>
<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>
<p>Content that identifies individuals by name and depicts their personal information, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>Driver’s licenses, Government IDs other than driver’s licenses, Green Cards, </p>
<p>or immigration papers </p>
<p>Marriage, birth, and name change certificates </p>
<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>License plates </p>
<p>Content that includes photographs that display the external view of private </p>
<p>residences if the following conditions apply: </p>
<p>The residence is a single-family home, or the resident’s unit number is </p>
<p>identified in the image/caption </p>

<p>explicitly mentions their undercover status, or </p>
<p>The content contains images identifying the faces of the law enforcement </p>
<p>personnel and explicitly mentions their undercover status </p>
<p>Content that exposes information about safe houses by sharing any of the below, </p>
<p>unless the safe house is actively promoting its location, contact information, or the </p>
<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>
<p>Identifiable city/neighborhood of the safe house, or </p>
<p>Information outing residents of the safe house </p>
<p>The following content also may be removed </p>
<p>A reported photo or video of people where the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>is: </p>
<p>A minor under thirteen years old, and the content was reported by the </p>
<p>minor or a parent or legal guardian, </p>
<p>A minor between thirteen and eighteen years old, and the content was </p>
<p>reported by the minor, </p>
<p>An adult, where the content was reported by the adult from outside the </p>
<p>United States and applicable law may provide rights to removal </p>
<p>Any person who is incapacitated and unable to report the content on </p>
<p>their own </p>
<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for </p>
<p>exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as </p>
<p>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">. </span>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>of <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>

<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>

<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private </p>
<p>individuals, unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or </p>
<p>high risk groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Content that exposes the identity or locations affiliated with any individual who is </p>
<p>alleged to be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share </p>
<p>familial and/or romantic relationships with a member of an at-risk group or have </p>
<p>performed professional activities in support of an at-risk group (except for political </p>
<p>figures). </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>
<p>Unless the aforementioned content is shared as part of recreational self </p>
<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>

<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>

<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery, real-time </p>
<p>depictions and fictional content that experts tell us might lead others to engage in </p>
<p>similar behavior. Self-injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the </p>
<p>body, including self-mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a </p>
<p>space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these </p>
<p>issues, and seek support from one another, which is why we allow people to discuss </p>
<p>suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or </p>

<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>

<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by posting or soliciting personally identifiable </p>

<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing personally identifiable information via </p>
<p>an external link </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing private financial information of an </p>
<p>organization or business </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by disclosing the following personal financial </p>
<p>information (of either the self or others) </p>
<p>Bank account and/or card information </p>
<p>Financial records paired with account information </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing the private contact information of </p>
<p>others defined as </p>
<p>Private phone numbers or addresses </p>
<p>Email, Messenger, and chat identities </p>
<p>The above information may be shared to promote charitable causes, non-</p>
<p>violating services, or to facilitate finding missing people or animals </p>
<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>
<p>Content that identifies individuals by name and depicts their personal information, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>Driver’s licenses, Government IDs other than driver’s licenses, Green Cards, </p>
<p>or immigration papers </p>
<p>Marriage, birth, and name change certificates </p>
<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>License plates </p>
<p>Content that includes photographs that display the external view of private </p>

<p>explicitly mentions their undercover status, or </p>
<p>The content contains images identifying the faces of the law enforcement </p>
<p>personnel and explicitly mentions their undercover status </p>
<p>Content that exposes information about safe houses by sharing any of the below, </p>
<p>unless the safe house is actively promoting its location, contact information, or the </p>
<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>
<p>Identifiable city/neighborhood of the safe house, or </p>
<p>Information outing residents of the safe house </p>

<p>A reported photo or video of people where the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>is: </p>
<p>A minor under thirteen years old, and the content was reported by the </p>
<p>minor or a parent or legal guardian, </p>
<p>A minor between thirteen and eighteen years old, and the content was </p>
<p>reported by the minor, </p>
<p>An adult, where the content was reported by the adult from outside the </p>
<p>United States and applicable law may provide rights to removal </p>
<p>Any person who is incapacitated and unable to report the content on </p>
<p>their own </p>
<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech,<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;"> st</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">tements of infe</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">iority, or calls </span>f<span style="background-color: red;">or</span><span style="background-color: green;">ul</span> <span style="background-color: green;">stereotypes, statements of </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">inferiority, or calls for </span>exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>of severity, as <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. </span>As <span style="background-color: red;">noted in Section 8 of our Community Standard</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">uch,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">(S</span><span style="background-color: green;">we have higher </span>ex<span style="background-color: red;">ual Ex</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">loitation of Adults), </p>

<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm</span>.<span style="background-color: red;"> We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury</span> </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. <span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their <span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">pr</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">matu</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">ious</span> <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span> </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>
<p>site </p>

<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>

<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>individuals, <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>high risk <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>

<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>

<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>

<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>

<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Content that exposes the identity or locations affiliated with any individual who is </p>
<p>alleged to be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery, real-time </p>
<p>depictions and fictional content that experts tell us might lead others to engage in </p>
<p>similar behavior. Self-injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the </p>
<p>body, including self-mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a </p>
<p>space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these </p>
<p>issues, and seek support from one another, which is why we allow people to discuss </p>
<p>suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>
<p>site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User <span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">R</span>equests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p><p><h1>20200930_vs_20201030</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>

<p></span><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery, real-time </p>
<p>depictions and fictional content that experts tell us might lead others to engage in </p>
<p>similar behavior. Self-injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the </p>
<p>body, including self-mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a </p>
<p>space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these </p>
<p>issues, and seek support from one another, which is why we allow people to discuss </p>
<p>suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or </p>

<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by posting or soliciting personally identifiable </p>

<p>an external link </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing private financial information of an </p>
<p>organization or business </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by disclosing the following personal financial </p>
<p>information (of either the self or others) </p>
<p>Bank account and/or card information </p>
<p>Financial records paired with account information </p>
<p>Content that facilitates identity theft by sharing the private contact information of </p>
<p>others defined as </p>
<p>Private phone numbers or addresses </p>
<p>Email, Messenger, and chat identities </p>
<p>The above information may be shared to promote charitable causes, non-</p>
<p>violating services, or to facilitate finding missing people or animals </p>
<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>
<p>Content that identifies individuals by name and depicts their personal information, </p>
<p>including: </p>

<p>Digital identities, including passwords </p>
<p>License plates </p>

<p>identified in the image/caption </p>

<p>explicitly mentions their undercover status, or </p>
<p>The content contains images identifying the faces of the law enforcement </p>
<p>personnel and explicitly mentions their undercover status </p>
<p>Content that exposes information about safe houses by sharing any of the below, </p>
<p>unless the safe house is actively promoting its location, contact information, or the </p>
<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>
<p>Identifiable city/neighborhood of the safe house, or </p>
<p>Information outing residents of the safe house </p>
<p>The following content also may be removed </p>
<p>A reported photo or video of people where the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>is: </p>
<p>A minor under thirteen years old, and the content was reported by the </p>
<p>minor or a parent or legal guardian, </p>
<p>A minor between thirteen and eighteen years old, and the content was </p>
<p>reported by the minor, </p>
<p>An adult, where the content was reported by the adult from outside the </p>
<p>United States and applicable law may provide rights to removal </p>
<p>Any person who is incapacitated and unable to report the content on </p>
<p>their own </p>
<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>
<p>site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>When we have additional context provided by the legacy contact or a family member </p>
<p>of the deceased, we may: </p>
<p>Remove bullying or harassment violations on a memorialized profile, which </p>
<p>normally require the individual to self-report </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><strong>25. User <span style="background-color: red;">R</span><span style="background-color: green;">r</span>equests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p><p><h1>20201030_vs_20201130</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>

<p>While we don’t allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote </p>
<p>suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want </p>
<p></span>Facebook<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;"> to be a space</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">here people can share their experiences, raise awareness </p>

<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>

<p><strong>7. Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we </p>
<p>become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for </p>
<p>Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We </p>
<p>know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good </p>
<p>intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for </p>
<p>abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or </p>
<p>misappropriating the images. </p>
<p>We also work with external experts, including the Facebook Safety Advisory Board, </p>
<p>to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, </p>
<p>especially with regard to children. Learn more about the new technology we’re using </p>
<p>to fight against child exploitation. </p>

<p>We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>

<p>from illegal sources. </p>
<p>We also provide people ways to report imagery that they believe to be in violation of </p>
<p>their privacy rights. </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content explicitly providing or offering to provide products or services that aim </p>
<p>to change people’s sexual orientation or gender identity<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p></span>Do not post:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p>Live streams of capital punishment of a person </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>

<p>dismemberment of non-regenerating body, unless in the wild </p>
<p>Imagery of humans committing acts of torture or abuse against live animals </p>
<p>Imagery of animals showing wounds or cuts that render visible innards or </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>discussion. <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or <span style="background-color: red;">coordinates </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">coordinates </span>sexual encounters <span style="background-color: green;">or commercial sexual services </span>between adults<span style="background-color: green;"> such </p>
<p>as prostitution or escort services</span>. We <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">als</span>o <span style="background-color: red;">res</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">h</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">s </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o avoid facilitating transactions that </p>
<p>may involve trafficking, coercion, and non-consensual</span> sexual<span style="background-color: red;">ly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">acts. We also restrict </p>
<p>s</span>ex<span style="background-color: red;">plicit lang</span>ua<span style="background-color: red;">ge</span><span style="background-color: green;">lly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">explici</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">hat</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">language that </span>may lead to solicitation because some audiences <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>within our global community may <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>be sensitive to this type of content and it may <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>impede the ability for people to <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>connect with their friends and the broader <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>community. </p>
<p>Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p><strong>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>activities, such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and paid sexual fetish or domination services.</strong></span> </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps </p>
<p>create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, </p>
<p>in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is </p>
<p>expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and </p>
<p>identity misrepresentation. That's why we require people to connect on Facebook </p>
<p>using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to </p>
<p>create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another </p>
<p>accountable. </p>
<p>In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove </p>
<p>accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the </p>
<p>security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of </p>
<p>automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to </p>
<p>persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to </p>
<p>give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community </p>
<p>Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to </p>
<p>the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued </p>
<p>violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe </p>
<p>safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.</span> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>
<p>site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so<span style="background-color: red;">. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public</span>. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Video<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>that ha</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> that have</span> been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity <span style="background-color: red;">or </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or </span>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe<span style="background-color: green;">:</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>A</span><span style="background-color: red;">that a</span> subject of the video <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>video, <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>word <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>"Remembering"<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>clear </span>that <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>To <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain <span style="background-color: red;">content </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">content </span>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p></span>When <span style="background-color: green;">brought to our attention by the legacy contact or a family member of the </p>

<p></span></p><p><h1>20201130_vs_20201230</h1></p><p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk </p>
<p>groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or<span style="background-color: red;">-</span> </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public </p>
<p>figures that includes: </p>
<p>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Content that exposes the identity or locations affiliated with any individual who is </p>
<p>alleged to be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share </p>
<p>familial and/or romantic relationships with a member of an at-risk group or have </p>
<p>performed professional activities in support of an at-risk group (except for political </p>
<p>figures). </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>

<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>
<p>Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: </p>
<p>Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for </p>
<p>example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational </p>
<p>purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing) </p>

<p>statements to bring weapons to locations, including but not limited to places of </p>
<p>worship, educational facilities polling places, or locations used to count votes or </p>
<p>administer an election ( or encouraging others to do the same). </p>

<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>veil against their will or without permission </p>
<p>Violent threats against law enforcement officers </p>

<p></span>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>To encourage safety and compliance with common legal restrictions, we prohibit </p>
<p>attempts by individuals, manufacturers, and retailers to purchase, sell, or trade non-</p>
<p>medical drugs, pharmaceutical drugs, and marijuana. We also prohibit the purchase, </p>
<p>sale, gifting, exchange, and transfer of firearms, including firearm parts or </p>
<p>ammunition, between private individuals on Facebook. Some of these items are not </p>
<p>regulated everywhere; however, because of the borderless nature of our community, </p>
<p>we try to enforce our policies as consistently as possible. Firearm stores and online </p>
<p>retailers may promote items available for sale off of our services as long as those </p>
<p>retailers comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We allow discussions about </p>
<p>sales of firearms and firearm parts in stores or by online retailers and advocating for </p>
<p>changes to firearm regulation. Regulated goods that are not prohibited by our </p>
<p>Community Standards may be subject to our more stringent Commerce Policies. </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly </p>
<p>consult with experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies and </p>
<p>enforcement, and work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to </p>
<p>people in distress. </p>
<p>While we don’t allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote </p>
<p>suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want </p>
<p>Facebook to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness </p>
<p>about these issues, and seek support from one another. </p>
<p>We define self-injury as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We remove any content that encourages suicide or </p>
<p>self-injury, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations and any self-</p>
<p>injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that </p>
<p>identifies and negatively targets victims or survivors of suicide or self-injury seriously, </p>
<p>humorously or rhetorically, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. </p>
<p>Content about recovery of suicide or self-harm that is allowed, but may contain </p>
<p>imagery that could be upsetting, such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity </p>
<p>screen. </p>
<p>When people post or search for suicide or self-injury- related content, we will direct </p>
<p>them to local organizations that can provide support and if someone is at immediate </p>
<p>risk of harming themselves, we will contact local emergency services to get them </p>
<p>help. </p>
<p>With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they </p>
<p>intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long </p>
<p>as possible, because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more </p>
<p>opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services. </p>
<p>However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this </p>
<p>content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an </p>
<p>attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we </p>
<p>identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who </p>
<p>are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury </p>
<p></span>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>
<p>Self-harm </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We may remove suicide notes when we have confirmation of a suicide or <span style="background-color: red;">suicide </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">suicide </span>attempt. We try to identify suicide notes using several factors, <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>including but not <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>limited to, family or legal representative requests, media <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>reports, law enforcement <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>7. Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we </p>
<p>become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for </p>
<p>Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We </p>
<p>know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good </p>
<p>intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for </p>
<p>abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or </p>
<p>misappropriating the images. </p>
<p>We also work with external experts, including the Facebook Safety Advisory Board, </p>
<p>to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, </p>
<p>especially with regard to children. Learn more about the new technology we’re using </p>
<p>to fight against child exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts participation in or advocates for the sexual exploitation of </p>
<p>children, including (but not limited to) </p>

<p>encourages participation in non-sexual child abuse </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>For the following content, we include a warning label so that people are aware that </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>In an effort to create space for this </p>
<p>conversation and promote<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>a safe environment, we allow victims to share their </p>
<p>experiences, but<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>violence, <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sexual assault, or sexual exploitation<span style="background-color: red;">, </span>. We also<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>remove content that <span style="background-color: red;">displays, </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">displays, </span>advocates for, or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>avoid <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>facilitating non-consensual sexual acts </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we also remove images that depict incidents of </p>
<p>sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>person(s)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>experts to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>issues, and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>we may remove content when they provide information that content is <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>linked to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>harmful activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>against <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>intimate images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put </p>
<p>together a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your </p>
<p>consent. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>
<p>Calling for, or making statements of intent to engage in, bullying and/or </p>

<p>include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur </p>
<p>Posting content about victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> </p>
<p>Content targeting a person or group of people (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of </p>
<p>their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: </p>
<p>Violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, </p>
<p>or unqualified behavioral statements (in written or visual form) to or about: </p>

<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Imagery of People</strong> </p>
<p>Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Live streams of capital punishment of a person </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>
<p><strong>Imagery of People</strong> </p>
<p>Videos of people or dead bodies in a medical setting if they depict </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>

<p>Imagery that shows acts of torture committed against a person or people </p>
<p>Imagery of non-medical foreign objects (such as metal objects, knives, nails) </p>
<p>involuntarily inserted or stuck into people causing grievous injury </p>
<p><strong>Imagery of Animals</strong> </p>
<p>The following content involving animals: </p>
<p>Videos depicting humans killing animals if there is no explicit manufacturing, </p>
<p>hunting, or food consumption, processing or preparation context </p>
<p>Imagery of animal to animal fights, when there are visible innards or </p>
<p>dismemberment of non-regenerating body, unless in the wild </p>
<p>Imagery of humans committing acts of torture or abuse against live animals </p>
<p>Imagery of animals showing wounds or cuts that render visible innards or </p>
<p>dismemberment, if there is no explicit manufacturing, hunting, taxidermy, </p>
<p>medical treatment, rescue or food consumption, preparation or processing </p>
<p>context or the animal is already skinned or with its outer layer fully removed. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content </p>
<p>may be sensitive: </p>
<p>Imagery of non-medical foreign objects voluntarily inserted into people through skin </p>
<p>in religious or cultural context </p>
<p>Imagery of visible innards in a birthing context </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We remove: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Videos and photos that show the violent death of someone when a family </p>
<p>member requests its removal<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>14. Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to </p>
<p>removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage </p>
<p>content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created </p>
<p>content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that </p>
<p>nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise </p>
<p>awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons. Where such intent </p>
<p>is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some </p>
<p>images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including </p>
<p>those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding, and </p>
<p>photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the </p>
<p>anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we </p>
<p>include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive. </p>
<p>We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude </p>
<p>figures. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Images of </p>
<p>Real nude adults, where nudity is defined as </p>
<p>Visible genitalia except in the context of birth giving and after-birth </p>
<p>moments or health-related situations (for example, gender confirmation </p>
<p>surgery, examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment) </p>
<p>Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless </p>
<p>photoshopped on a public figure </p>
<p>Uncovered female nipples except in the context of breastfeeding, birth </p>
<p>giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, </p>
<p>post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation </p>
<p>surgery) or an act of protest </p>
<p>Sexual activity, including </p>
<p>Sexual intercourse </p>
<p>Explicit sexual intercourse, defined as mouth or genitals entering </p>
<p>or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, where at </p>
<p>least one person's genitals are nude </p>
<p>Implied sexual intercourse, defined as mouth or genitals </p>
<p>entering or in contact with another person's genitals or anus, </p>
<p>even when the contact is not directly visible, except in cases of a </p>
<p>sexual health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional </p>
<p>images or with indicators of fiction </p>
<p>Implied stimulation of genitalia/anus, defined as stimulating </p>
<p>genitalia/anus or inserting objects into genitalia/anus, even when </p>
<p>the activity is not directly visible, except in cases of sexual </p>
<p>health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional images </p>
<p>or with indicators of fiction </p>
<p>Other sexual activities including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>Erections </p>
<p>Presence of by-products of sexual activity </p>
<p>Stimulating genitals or anus, even if above or under clothing </p>
<p>Use of sex toys, even if above or under clothing </p>
<p>Stimulation of naked human nipples </p>
<p>Squeezing female breasts, defined as a grabbing motion with </p>
<p>curved fingers that shows both marks and clear shape change </p>
<p>of the breasts. We allow squeezing in breastfeeding contexts </p>
<p>Fetish content that involves </p>
<p>Acts that are likely to lead to the death of a person or animal </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>
<p>Cannibalism </p>
<p>Feces, urine, spit, snot, menstruation, or vomit </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Digital Content that meets our definition of sexual activity, except when </p>
<p>posted in an educational or scientific context, or when it meets one of </p>
<p>the criteria below and shown only to individuals 18 years and older. </p>
<p>We only show this content to individuals 18 and older: </p>
<p>Real world art that depicts sexual activity </p>
<p>Posting photographs or videos of objects that depict sexual activity in real </p>
<p>world art </p>
<p>Implied sexual activity in advertisements </p>
<p>Implied sexual activity in recognized fictional images or with indicators of </p>
<p>fiction </p>
<p>Digital content that meets our definition of sexual activity, where: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>The sexual activity (intercourse or other sexual activities) isn’t directly </p>
<p>visible </p>
<p>Content was posted in a satirical or humorous context </p>
<p>Only body shapes or contours are visible<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this </p>
<p>discussion. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults such </p>
<p>as prostitution or escort services. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that </p>
<p>may involve trafficking, coercion, and non-consensual sexual acts. We also restrict </p>
<p>sexually explicit language that may lead to solicitation because some audiences </p>
<p>within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content and it may </p>
<p>impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader </p>
<p>community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>activities, such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and paid sexual fetish or domination services.</strong> </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>17. Account Integrity and Authentic Identity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps </p>
<p>create a community where people are <span style="background-color: green;">.</span><span style="background-color: red;">accoun</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o e</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ch other, and to Face</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">le t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> each </span>o<span style="background-color: green;">k</span><span style="background-color: red;">ther</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">i</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>meaningful ways. We wan</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;"> allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is </p>
<p>expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and </p>
<p>identity misrepresentation. That's why we require people to connect on</span> Facebook<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">in meaningf</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">sing the name they go by in everyday </span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ife. Our authenticity policies are intended to </p>
<p>create a safe environment</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">here people c</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">n tru</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">t and hold one another </p>
<p>accountable</span>. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove </p>
<p>accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the </p>
<p>security of other accounts and our services. </span>We <span style="background-color: green;">have built a combination of </p>
<p>automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to </p>
<p>persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Because account level removal is a severe action, </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">he</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">ever</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">p</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> a</span><span style="background-color: green;">ssib</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">lo</span><span style="background-color: green;">e, </span>w<span style="background-color: red;"> for th</span>e <span style="background-color: red;">r</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">im</span><span style="background-color: red;">nge</span> <span style="background-color: green;">t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span> <span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued </p>

<p>safety risks will lead to an account being disabled. </p>

<p>In order to ma</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove </p>
<p>accounts t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">at</span> <span style="background-color: red;">are harmful to the community, including those that com</span>pro<span style="background-color: red;">mise the </p>
<p>security of other accounts and our services. We have bui</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">t a c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">mbi</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ation of </p>
<p>automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to </p>
<p>persistently or e</span>g<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">giously abuse our Community Stan</span>d<span style="background-color: red;">ards.</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to </p>

<p>the severit</span>y<span style="background-color: red;"> of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued </p>
<p>violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe </p>
<p>safety risks will lead to an account being disabled. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>

<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;"> and</span> detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities<span style="background-color: green;">, and can threaten the security, stability, </p>
<p>and usability of our services</span>. We also aim to prevent people from <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>abusing our <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>distribute <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>content <span style="background-color: green;"><em></span>en masse<span style="background-color: green;"></em></span> for commercial gain.<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>

<p></span><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information<span style="background-color: green;"> and accounts and our services</span>. Attempts to gather sensitive personal <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information by deceptive or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>safe atmosphere that we <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>want to foster<span style="background-color: green;">, and can be used to compromise user </p>
<p>accounts and our services</span>. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive <span style="background-color: red;">user </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">user </span>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to <span style="background-color: green;">protect the security of user </p>
<p>accounts and our services, and </span>create a space where people can <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>trust the people <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Videos that have been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity </p>
<p>or quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe: </p>
<p>A subject of the video said words that they did not say, AND </p>
<p>The video is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, </p>
<p>including deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that </p>
<p>merges, combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a </p>
<p>video, creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said.<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the word </p>
<p>"Remembering" appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it that </p>
<p>the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. </p>
<p>To support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain </p>
<p>content when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>When brought to our attention by the legacy contact or a family member of the </p>
<p>deceased, we will: </p>
<p>Remove violating comments on a memorialized profile, which would typically </p>
<p>require the individual to self report so that we know that they are unwanted </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an underage account </p>
<p>Government requests for removal of child abuse imagery depicting, for </p>
<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>We may remove content created for the purpose of identifying a private minor if there </p>
<p>may be a risk to the minor’s safety when requested </p>
