<p></span><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the</p>
<p>means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their</p>
<p>words. We insist that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you</p>
<p>encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and provide critical</p>
<p>feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner,</p>
<p>you will be banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so</p>
<p>you can rack up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people,</p>
<p>and so we strongly encourage you to find people who share your interests and</p>
<p>connect with them. The more you interact with others, the more others will be</p>
<p>interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p>feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner,</p>
<p>you will be banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so</p>
<p>you can rack up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people,</p>
<p>and so we strongly encourage you to find people who share your interests and</p>
<p>connect with them. The more you interact with others, the more others will be</p>
<p>interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Speech Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>
<p>banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>
<p>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you</p>
<p>to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,</p>
<p>the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>
<p>banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>
<p>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>

<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>
<p>banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>
<p>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you</p>
<p>to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,</p>
<p>the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>
<p>the video description (maps and mods to commercial games are not allowed). No commercial video game</p>
<p>trailers are permitted.</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>
<p>banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>
<p>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you</p>
<p>to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,</p>
<p>the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>"I have permission" does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after the video unless given</p>
<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>
<p>will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting,</p>
<p>work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for businesses who have</p>
<p>coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory speech; or depict unlawful</p>
<p>acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and the video depicts only</p>
<p>your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima videos with a story are</p>
<p>allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they cite their involvement in</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to insult</p>
<p>and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you are on</p>
<p>Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and</p>
<p>provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face,</p>
<p>don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful manner, you will be</p>
<p></span>banished forever.</p>
<p><strong>Go forth and connect</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack up</p>
<p>views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly encourage you</p>
<p>to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you interact with others,</p>
<p>the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get involved!</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>

<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our community</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments</p>
<p>from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive</p>
<p>community of individuals with a wide range of passions. We hope that this environment fuels your</p>
<p>own creativity and inspires you to contribute to the Vimeo community in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“I have permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works to which they have</p>
<p>contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos. Businesses may,</p>
<p>however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists, musicians, nonprofits, and</p>
<p>actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>

<p>prior written permission from an authorized member of the Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them</p>

<p><strong>THE VIMEO COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who</p>
<p>wanted to share their creative work and</p>
<p>personal moments from their lives. As time</p>
<p>went on, likeminded people discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community of</p>

<p>that this environment fuels your own creativity and</p>

<p>Our practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“I have permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works</p>
<p>to which they have contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos.</p>
<p>Businesses may, however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as</p>
<p>they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists,</p>
<p>musicians, nonprofits, and actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after</p>
<p>the video unless given prior written permission from an authorized member of the</p>
<p>Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick</p>
<p>schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-</p>
<p>making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate</p>
<p>walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for</p>
<p>businesses who have coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other</p>
<p>partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is</p>
<p>allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory</p>
<p>speech; or depict unlawful acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and</p>
<p>the video depicts only your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs</p>
<p>or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima</p>
<p>videos with a story are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to</p>
<p>avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they</p>
<p>cite their involvement in the video description (maps and mods to commercial games</p>
<p>are not allowed). No commercial video game trailers are permitted.</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to</p>
<p>insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while</p>
<p>you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free</p>
<p>to disagree and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it</p>
<p>to someone's face, don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful</p>
<p>manner, you will be banished forever.</p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack</p>
<p>up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly</p>
<p>encourage you to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you</p>

<p><strong>THE VIMEO COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded by filmmakers who</p>
<p>wanted to share their creative work and</p>
<p>personal moments from their lives. As time</p>
<p>went on, likeminded people discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community of</p>

<p>that this environment fuels your own creativity and</p>

<p>If you have questions about what’s on this page, look</p>
<p>here first: <strong>Help</strong> / <strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>Our practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>1. I will upload only videos I created myself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“I have permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>Directors, DPs, editors, musicians, graphic effects artists, and actors may upload works</p>
<p>to which they have contributed significantly.</p>
<p>Public domain videos are not allowed.</p>
<p>Please add your role/involvement in the video description to avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p><strong>2. I will not upload videos intended for commercial use.</strong></p>
<p>Businesses may not use basic Vimeo or <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> accounts to host their videos.</p>
<p>Businesses may, however, use a <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> account to host their videos so long as</p>
<p>they comply with the <strong>Vimeo PRO guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceptions are made for: Independent production companies, authors, artists,</p>
<p>musicians, nonprofits, and actors who want to promote the work they have created.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos containing ads that are displayed before, during, or after</p>
<p>the video unless given prior written permission from an authorized member of the</p>
<p>Vimeo staff. Videos with advertisements in them will be removed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), get-rich-quick</p>
<p>schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home businesses, or any other dubious money-</p>
<p>making ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload product promotions or sales videos such as real estate</p>
<p>walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Television stations may not use Vimeo to redistribute their programming.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to allow the uploading of certain commercial content for</p>
<p>businesses who have coordinated sponsored advertising campaigns or other</p>
<p>partnerships with Vimeo.</p>
<p><strong>3. I understand that certain types of content are not permitted on Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload sexually explicit material or pornography. Non-sexual nudity is</p>
<p>allowed.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that incite hatred; include defamatory or discriminatory</p>
<p>speech; or depict unlawful acts or extreme violence.</p>
<p>You may post videos of yourself on TV, as long as you have permission to upload and</p>
<p>the video depicts only your involvement in the program.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that are clips or compilations of scenes from TV programs</p>
<p>or movies.</p>
<p>You may not upload captures of video games or gameplay, even if edited. Machinima</p>
<p>videos with a story are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to</p>
<p>avoid accidental deletion.</p>
<p>Video game developers may post videos of their work in development, provided they</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. </span>O<span style="background-color: red;">ur practical and et</span>h<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;">ical</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;">guide to usi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d don’t send unsolicited mass</p>

<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, but we've noticed that it also gives people the means to</p>
<p>insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while</p>
<p>you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free</p>
<p>to disagree and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. If you wouldn't say it</p>
<p>to someone's face, don't say it on Vimeo. And if you cannot conduct yourself in a respectful</p>
<p>manner, you will be banished forever.</p>
<p>Vimeo is not a sea of eyeballs that you must trick into watching your videos so you can rack</p>
<p>up views. It's a vibrant community of intelligent and creative people, and so we strongly</p>
<p>encourage you to find people who share your interests and connect with them. The more you</p>
<p>interact with others, the more others will be interested in your work. So go ahead – get</p>
<p>involved!</p>

<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>

<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>

<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>

<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>

<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>

<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p>Thanks a billion for being a part of Vimeo and helping us keep the Internet’s most awesome community of creative people really, uh,</p>
<p>awesome. (You guys are the creative people — come up with something better!)</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>want to upload videos with a commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your</p>
<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use</p>
<p>any account type (Basic, Plus, or PRO) to showcase your creative work.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), affiliate programs,</p>
<p>get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home gigs, or similar ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience</strong></p>
<p><strong>should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that</p>
<p>adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g., by flooding search results) should remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep</p>
<p>these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO members can use <strong>Private Mode</strong> to easily hide their videos from</p>
<p>Vimeo.com. <strong>Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or</p>
<p>the Vimeo Forum for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo</p>

<p>Thanks a billion for being a part of Vimeo and helping us keep the Internet’s most awesome community of creative people really, uh,</p>
<p>awesome. (You guys are the creative people — come up with something better!)</p>

<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>

<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>want to upload videos with a commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your</p>
<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use</p>
<p>any account type (Basic, Plus, or PRO) to showcase your creative work.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), affiliate programs,</p>
<p>get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home gigs, or similar ventures.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience</strong></p>
<p><strong>should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that</p>
<p>adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g., by flooding search results) should remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep</p>
<p>these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>want to upload videos with a commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your</p>
<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>

<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use</p>

<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos pertaining to multi-level marketing (MLM), affiliate programs,</p>
<p>get-rich-quick schemes, cash gifting, work-from-home gigs, or similar ventures.</p>

<p>website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience</strong></p>

<p>adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g., by flooding search results) should remain</p>
<p>private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep</p>
<p>these videos private.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>

<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>want to upload videos with a commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your</p>
<p>company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>

<p>these videos private.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>

<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>

<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p>No screen-captures of video games or gameplay videos, even if edited. (<strong>Exception!</strong></p>
<p>Game developers can upload examples of their own work. Machinima videos with a story</p>
<p>also are allowed, but must be labeled as such in the video description to avoid deletion.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>here first: <strong>Help</strong> / <strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>

<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong>/Vimeo Guidelines</p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech.</p>
<p><strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or</p>
<p>cruelty toward animals.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who</p>
<p>wanted to share creative work and personal</p>
<p>moments from their lives. As time went on,</p>
<p>other likeminded individuals discovered</p>
<p>Vimeo and helped build a supportive community</p>
<p>covering a wide range of interests. In other words,</p>
<p>Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and</p>
<p>the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical</p>
<p>humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you</p>
<p>to create and contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass</p>
<p>others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that</p>
<p>while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You</p>
<p>are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community.</p>
<p>You should also watch and comment on other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>,</p>
<p>and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like</p>
<p>human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor,</p>
<p>musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.) as long as you have the necessary</p>
<p>permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read</p>
<p>more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on</p>
<p>other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>, and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited</p>
<p>mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt</p>
<p>people’s experience here<span style="background-color: green;">. Last, don’t pay for views or likes or use other spammy methods to inflate your stats</span>.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you want to upload videos with a</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on</p>
<p>other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>, and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited</p>
<p>mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt</p>
<p>people’s experience here. Last, don’t pay for views or likes or use other spammy methods to inflate your stats.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you want to upload videos with a</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on</p>
<p>other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>, and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited</p>
<p>mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt</p>
<p>people’s experience here. Last, don’t pay for views or likes or use other spammy methods to inflate your stats.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you want to upload videos with a</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type (Basic, Plus, or PRO)</p>

<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO members can use <strong>Private Mode</strong> to easily hide their videos from Vimeo.com. <strong>Learn more about hosting</strong></p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on</p>
<p>other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>, and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited</p>
<p>mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt</p>
<p>people’s experience here. Last, don’t pay for views or likes or use other spammy methods to inflate your stats.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote unlawful acts, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you want to upload videos with a</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial intent, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on your company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request, nay— we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community. You should also watch and comment on</p>
<p>other people’s videos, follow people, join <strong>Groups</strong>, and follow <strong>Channels</strong> related to your interests. Oh, and don’t send unsolicited</p>
<p>mass messages. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt</p>
<p>people’s experience here. Last, don’t pay for views or likes or use other spammy methods to inflate your stats.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>

<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>

<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>

<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read</strong></p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read</strong></p>
<p><strong>more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join <strong>groups</strong>, follow other members</p>
<p>and <strong>channels</strong> related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our <strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong> as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights and</p>
<p>permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>fair use</strong>.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. <strong>Read more</strong>.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. <strong>Read</strong></p>
<p><strong>more</strong>.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. <strong>Read more</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>

<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>

<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>

<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong> <strong>/ Vimeo Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community</span> Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>

<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Help Center</strong> <strong>/ Vimeo Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>

<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>

<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>

<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>

<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>

<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>

<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission��? does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>

<p>A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment).</p>
<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission<span style="background-color: green;">”</span><span style="background-color: red;">��?</span> does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission<span style="background-color: red;">”</span><span style="background-color: green;">��?</span> does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Vimeo PRO and Vimeo Business members can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the</p>
<p>necessary rights and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornography. (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
<p><strong>MORE TO EXPLORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses may not use Vimeo Basic or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Plus</strong> <strong>to host videos. If you are a business or wish to upload</strong></p>
<p><strong>commercial content, you must use</strong> <strong>Vimeo PRO</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Vimeo Business</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial content includes:</p>
<p>Videos promoting or representing a for-profit business or brand.</p>
<p>Videos containing any form of advertising.</p>
<p>Videos hosted on behalf of a business (e.g., uploaded to Vimeo and embedded on a company’s website).</p>
<p>Content that you intend to sell.</p>
<p>Product demos and tutorials.</p>
<p>Corporate training videos.</p>
<p>If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your</p>
<p>creative work. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>There are certain types of commercial content we never allow.</strong></p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p>You may not upload spam or flood Vimeo with videos intended to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial videos that may be disruptive to Vimeo viewers’ experience should remain private.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is a place to share and discover amazing videos. Commercial content that adversely affects on-site video discovery (e.g.,</p>
<p>by flooding search results) should remain private.</p>
<p>If you’re uploading lots of similar, promotional videos (e.g., product demos), please keep these videos private.</p>
<p>Videos focused on short term sales (e.g., real estate walk-throughs) should also remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or</p>
<p>through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses in the Vimeo Community:</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Violations of any Vimeo Guidelines may lead to the removal of your videos and/or your Vimeo account. Learn how to report a</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Content Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>

<p><strong>Be cool and play nice.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility</p>
<p>for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their</p>
<p>videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t spam or disrupt Vimeo.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and</p>
<p>channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass</p>
<p>messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a</p>
<p>robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t be a creep.</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with</p>
<p>comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make</p>
<p>sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate</p>
<p>any other person or business.</p>
<p><strong>Upload only videos you created yourself.</strong></p>
<p>You must own or hold all necessary rights (copyrights, etc.) to your video.</p>
<p>“So-and-so gave me permission” does not mean you created it.</p>
<p>You can upload videos that you appear in or helped create (as director, DP, editor, musician, motion graphics artist, actor, etc.)</p>
<p>as long as you have the necessary permissions from the copyright holders.</p>
<p>Please add your role in the video description to avoid deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Exception!</strong> Members with paid subscriptions can upload videos they did not create as long as they hold the necessary rights</p>
<p>and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot upload certain types of content:</strong></p>
<p>No rips of movies, music, television, or any other third party copyrighted material. Read more about copyright and fair use.</p>
<p>No sexually explicit material or pornograph</span>y.<span style="background-color: red;"> (Artistic and non-sexual nudity is allowed. Read more.)</p>
<p>You may not upload videos promoting products and services of an erotic nature. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that are hateful, harass others, violate someone's privacy, or include defamatory or discriminatory speech. Read</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>No videos that depict or promote violent activity, extreme or real-life violence, self-harm, or cruelty toward animals. Read more.</p>
<p>No videos that make false or misleading claims about vaccination safety or claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes.</p>
<p>You may not upload videos that promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes. Read more.</p>
<p><strong>OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded</p>
<p>individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of</p>
<p>real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and</p>
<p>contribute in positive ways.</p>
