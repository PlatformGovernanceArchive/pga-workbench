<p><strong>Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies</strong></p>
<p>As you navigate through and interact with our Websites, we use automatic data collection technologies to collect website activity data.</p>
<p>We use <strong>cookies</strong>, which are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website</p>
<p>We currently use the following types of cookies, which are set by the Websites’ domains, or by other domains we own or control:</p>
<p><em>Strictly necessary cookies:</em> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Websites. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log in to our</p>
<p>Websites and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.</p>
<p><em>Functionality cookies:</em> These cookies help us to personalize and enhance your online experience on our Websites. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you</p>
<p>return to our Websites and to remember, for example, your choice of language.</p>
<p><em>Analytics cookies:</em> These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Websites. These cookies help us to</p>
<p>improve our Websites, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.</p>
<p><em>Targeting and Advertising cookies:</em> These cookies record visits of a user on our Websites, the pages a user visits and the links a user follows in order to enable us to make</p>
<p>our Websites more relevant to the user’s interests and to help us serve ads that might be of interest to the user. Targeting and advertising cookies are only used for</p>
<p>unregistered users and registered users.</p>
<p>Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it</p>
<p>expires or you delete your cookies.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some</p>
<p>parts of the Websites may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Google Analytics.</strong> We use Google as a service provider to collect and analyze information about how users use the Websites, including by collecting</p>
<p>website activity data through first-party cookies set by our domains, and third-party cookies set by Google. Because we activated IP anonymization for Google</p>
<p>Analytics, Google will anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address and will not store your full IP address. Google will use the information only for the purpose</p>
<p>of providing Google Analytics services to us, and will not use this information for other purposes. The information collected by Google Analytics may be transmitted</p>
<p>to and stored by Google on servers in the United States pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the EU. You can learn more on how Google uses data</p>
<p>here, and you can opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on Pornhub are provided or served by third parties. These third parties may use cookies alone or in</p>
<p>conjunction with other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use Pornhub. Unless expressly stated otherwise, Pornhub does not provide</p>
<p>any personal information to these third parties, however they may collect information, including your IP address, advertisements you click, time zone setting and</p>
<p>location, and information about your browser, operating system and devices you use to access Pornhub. They may use this information to provide you with interest-</p>
<p>based advertising or other targeted content. They may track users across different websites and over time.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all third-party cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Websites because such</p>
<p>information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a</p>
<p>question; or initiate other transactions on our Websites.</p>
<p>As explained in the section <em>Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies,</em> you may set your browser to refuse some or all cookies. In addition, you may opt out of</p>
<p>Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us using the opt-out link provided in our emails. If you are a Registered User, we may continue to send you other types of</p>
<p>transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as emails about your account or orders, administrative notices, and surveys.</p>
<p>You may use your account settings to delete your user contributions and audio/video information.</p>
<p>You may also delete and deactivate your account with us at any time. If you do so, your profile will no longer be accessible by you. If you later choose to have an account with</p>
<p>us, you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved within your account will have been saved.</p>
<p><strong>Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>You have certain rights regarding the personal information we collect, use or disclose and that is related to you, including the right:</p>
<p>to receive information on the personal information we hold about you and how such personal information is used (right to access);</p>
<p>to correct inaccurate personal information concerning you (right to data rectification);</p>
<p>to delete/erase your personal information (right to deletion, “right to be forgotten”);</p>
<p>to receive the personal information provided by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit the personal information to another data</p>
<p>controller (right to data portability)</p>
<p>to object to the use of your personal information where such use is based on our legitimate interests or on public interests (right to object);</p>
<p>in some cases, to restrict our use of your personal information (right to restriction of processing); and</p>
<p>to withdraw your consent at any time where our processing is based on consent.</p>
<p>You may exercise your right to access and deletion using the buttons at the bottom of this page. Additionally, you may, at any time, send us an e-mail at</p>
<p>support@pornhub.com to exercise your above rights in accordance with the applicable legal requirements and limitations. If you are located in the European</p>
<p>Economic Area or the UK, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>
<p>Please note that unless you have created an account with us, we may not have sufficient information to identify you and therefore may not be in a position to respond</p>
<p>to your request. Additionally, in some cases in order to adequately verify your identity or your authorization to make the request, we may require you to provide</p>
<p>additional information.</p>
<p>Note that some requests to delete certain personal information will require the deletion of your user account as the provision of user accounts are inextricably linked</p>
<p>to the use of certain personal information (e.g., your e-mail address).</p>
<p><strong>California Rights and Choices</strong></p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides you certain rights in relation to your personal information:</p>
<p><em>Right to Know:</em> You have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection of your personal information over the past 12 months, including the</p>
<p>specific pieces of information we collected.</p>

<p>forth in the CCPA.</p>
<p><em>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Rights:</em> We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.</p>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, please use the buttons at the bottom of this page or email us at support@pornhub.com with the email subject line “CCPA</p>
<p>Request.” In either case you will need to provide the following information to verify your identity and enable us to locate your information in our systems: your</p>
<p>username and email address that you used to create an account with us, as well as any other information which we may reasonably request in order for us to verify</p>
<p>your identity. We may require you verify that you have access to your account and/or email account that you used to register with us.</p>
<p>You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the</p>
<p>information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the</p>
<p>methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so.</p>
<p>We disclose certain categories of California residents’ personal information for our business purposes, as described in the section above titled Disclosure of Your</p>
<p>Personal Information.</p>
<p>We do not sell California residents’ personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Notice to Nevada Residents/Your Nevada Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>We do not exchange Nevada residents’ personal information for money with anyone so they may license or sell the personal information to additional parties.</p>
<p><strong>Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries</strong></p>
<p>Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using the Websites you consent to the transfer of information that we collect about you, including personal</p>
<p>information, to other countries in which we, members of our corporate group (including affiliates and related entities) or our service providers are located. When we</p>
<p>transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure</p>
<p>that the information is transferred in accordance with the applicable laws. Where relevant, our transfers outside the EEA are made pursuant to standard contractual</p>
<p>clauses approved for use by the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Retention of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for</p>
<p>the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider a number of factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm</p>
<p>from any unauthorised disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your personal information from our</p>
<p>systems.</p>
<p>Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained above in the section <em>“Your Rights Related to Your Personal</em></p>
<p><em>Information”</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Links and Sites</strong></p>
<p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read</p>
<p>the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third party practices.</p>
