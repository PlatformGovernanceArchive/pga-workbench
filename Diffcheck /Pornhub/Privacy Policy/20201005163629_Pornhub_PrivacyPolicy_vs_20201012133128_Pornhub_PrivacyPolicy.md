Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.


Where you declare your valid consent to use it.


Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.


**Purposes for Which We Use Your Personal Information**


In general, we use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information, for following purposes:


Provision of services (Registered Members Only): to present our Website and its contents to you, including any interactive features on our Website, and to provide you with

We may disclose your Personal Information to members of our corporate group (that is, entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us) to the


extent this is necessary for the purposes of provision of services, customer management, customization of content, advertising, analytics, verifications, functionality and

Legal successors. To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our


assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Website users is among


the assets transferred. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal information


uses it in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.


We access, preserve and share your Personal Information with regulators, law enforcement or others where we reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy

**Retention of Personal Information**


We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or


reporting requirements.


To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from


unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other


means, and the applicable legal requirements.


Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your Personal Data from our systems.

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and


disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we


use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining


access to your Personal Information. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.
