<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is</p>
<p>yours — you own your Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).</p>
<p>By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-</p>
<p>exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify,</p>
<p>publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known</p>

<p>let others do the same. You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and</p>
<p>improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other</p>
<p>companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication</p>
<p>of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such</p>
<p>additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals, may be made with no</p>
<p>compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make</p>
<p>available through the Services.</p>
<p>Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services.</p>
<p>These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify</p>

<p>make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media. You represent and warrant</p>
<p>that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content</p>
<p>that you submit.</p>
<p>Please review the Twitter Rules, which are part of the User Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the</p>
<p>Services. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and</p>

<p>Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We</p>
<p>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the Services to you or to</p>
<p>users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time.</p>
<p>We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, suspend or terminate users, and</p>
<p>reclaim usernames without liability to you.</p>
<p>In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its</p>
<p>third-party providers and partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of</p>
<p>Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse</p>
<p>our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface</p>
<p>and the instructions that we provide. You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the</p>
<p>Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Twitter’s computer systems, or the</p>
<p>technical delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or</p>
<p>network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to</p>
<p>access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently</p>
<p>available, published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and</p>
<p>conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE:</p>
<p>crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however,</p>
<p>scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP</p>
<p>packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to</p>

<p>do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading,</p>
<p>flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as</p>
<p>to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read,</p>
<p>preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable</p>
<p>law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of</p>
<p>potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv)</p>

<p>If you use commerce features of the Services that require credit or debit card information, such as our Buy</p>
<p>Now feature, you agree to our Twitter Commerce Terms (https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171943).</p>
<p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
<p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your</p>
<p>account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any</p>
<p>loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>
<p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain</p>
<p>communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are</p>
<p>considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If</p>
<p>you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you</p>
<p>must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your</p>
<p>old number.</p>
<p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the</p>
<p>software provided to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and</p>
<p>enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign</p>
<p>countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks,</p>
<p>logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services</p>
<p>(excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Twitter and its licensors.</p>
<p>Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Twitter, or the Services is entirely</p>
<p>voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any</p>
<p>obligation to you.</p>
<p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing</p>
<p>your use of the Services. See http://support.twitter.com/articles/15358-how-to-deactivate-your-account for</p>
<p>instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens</p>
<p>to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time</p>
<p>for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms</p>
<p>or the Twitter Rules, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed</p>
<p>due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We</p>
<p>will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time</p>
<p>you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall</p>
<p>terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections</p>
<p>shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI.</p>
<p><strong>The Services are Available “AS-IS”</strong></p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that</p>
<p>the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The “Twitter Entities” refers to</p>
<p>Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,</p>
<ol>
<li>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</li>
</ol>
<p>partners, and licensors. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law,</p>
<p>THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR</p>
<p>IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>The Twitter Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the</p>
<p>completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any</p>
<p>harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the</p>
<p>Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other</p>
<p>communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be</p>
<p>available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written,</p>
<p>obtained from the Twitter Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not</p>
<p>expressly made herein.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TWITTER ENTITIES SHALL NOT</p>
<p>BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,</p>
<p>OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR</p>
<p>ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i)</p>
<p>YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY</p>
<p>CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT</p>
<p>LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS,</p>
<p>USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE</p>
<p>AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE TWITTER ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S.</p>
<p>DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TWITTER, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS</p>
<p>FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL</p>
<p>APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE,</p>
<p>TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES</p>
<p>HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET</p>
<p>FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current</p>
<p>version of the Terms, which will always be at twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. We will try to</p>
<p>notify you of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with</p>
<p>your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree</p>
<p>to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any</p>
<p>dispute that arises between you and Twitter. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be</p>
<p>brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and</p>
<p>you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official</p>
<p>capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those</p>
<p>clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related</p>
<p>thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws)</p>
<p>and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of</p>
<p>California (excluding choice of law).</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be</p>
<p>limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will</p>
<p>remain in full force and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be</p>
<ol>
<li>General</li>
</ol>
<p>Twitter Terms of Service</p>
<p>deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Services</li>
</ol>
<p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your</p>
<p>account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any</p>
<p>loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>
<p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain</p>
<p>communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are</p>
<p>considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If</p>
<p>you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you</p>
<p>must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your</p>
<p>old number.</p>

<p>enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign</p>

<p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing</p>
<p>your use of the Services. See http://support.twitter.com/articles/15358-how-to-deactivate-your-account for</p>
<p>instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens</p>
<p>to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time</p>
<p>for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms</p>
<p>or the Twitter Rules, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed</p>
<p>due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision</p>
<p>of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the</p>
<p>email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending</p>
<p>on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to</p>
<p>use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI. If you believe your</p>
<p>account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our help center</p>
<p>(https://support.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended).</p>
<p>By using the Services you agree that Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors,</p>
<p>employees, agents representatives, partners and licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent</p>
<p>permissible in your country of residence.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current</p>
<p>version of the Terms, which will always be at twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. Other than</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Limitations of Liability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of</p>
<p>making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for</p>
<p>example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to</p>
<p>access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised</p>
<p>Terms.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be</p>
<p>limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will</p>
<p>remain in full force and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be</p>
<p>deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
