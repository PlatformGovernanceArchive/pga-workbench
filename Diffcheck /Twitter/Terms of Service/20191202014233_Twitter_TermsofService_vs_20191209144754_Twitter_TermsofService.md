deactivation or termination of your account</span>.

**6. General**


We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>effective changes to these Terms that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>be bound by the revised Terms.


In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>eliminated to the minimum extent<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

**Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content**


You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your


incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered part of the Content).


By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to


sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution


methods (now known or later developed). This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same.


You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the


Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content on


other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or


individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available


through the Services.


Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open


ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by


us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.



You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights


granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to


copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant Twitter the

otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and


conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in


accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge


any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false


source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation,


sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with


or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is


necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential


violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights,

use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.


You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and


administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving


them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information



to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.


**Your License to Use the Services**


Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services.


This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these


Terms.


The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to


use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. All right, title, and interest in and to the

Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI.


**5. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability**


**The Services are Available "AS-IS"**


Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and


“AS AVAILABLE” basis. The “Twitter Entities” refers to Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,


partners, and licensors. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL


WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-


INFRINGEMENT. The Twitter Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy,

maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No


advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Twitter Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not


expressly made herein.


**Limitation of Liability**


TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TWITTER ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,


CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF


DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE

THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE,


TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY


SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.


**6. General**


We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at


twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the


email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised


Terms.


The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Twitter. All


disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States,


and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.


If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the


controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any


action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law


and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).


In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent


necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms


will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.


These Terms are an agreement between you and Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A. If you have any questions about


these Terms, please contact </span>us.
