<p>you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what</p>
<p>you Tweet!</p>

<p>also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time</p>
<p>without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information</p>
<p>on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent</p>
<p>of advertising by Twitter on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Twitter</p>
<p>granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third party</p>
<p>providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the</p>

<p>our terms and conditions for such Content use.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how API developers can interact with your</p>
<p>content. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind.</p>
<p>Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner</p>
<p>with Twitter, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that</p>
<p>you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.</p>

<p>to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if</p>
<p>done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services</p>
<p>without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header</p>

<p>the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the</p>
<p>Services.</p>

<p>do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with</p>
<p>applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been</p>
<p>copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following</p>
<p>information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized</p>
<p>to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</p>
<p>(iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing</p>
<p>activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information</p>
<p>reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including</p>
<p>your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a</p>
<p>good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the</p>
<p>copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification</p>
<p>is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the</p>
<p>copyright owner.</p>

<p>sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user’s account if the</p>
<p>user is determined to be a repeat infringer. Our designated copyright agent for notice of</p>
<p>alleged copyright infringement appearing on the Services is:</p>
