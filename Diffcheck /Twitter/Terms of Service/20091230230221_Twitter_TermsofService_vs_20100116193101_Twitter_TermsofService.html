<p>Settings page to control who sees your Content). You should only provide Content that you are</p>
<p>comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</p>
<p>Tip What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you</p>

<p>prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support</p>

<p>access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our</p>
<p>currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to those</p>
<p>terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement</p>
<p>with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of</p>
<p>the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly</p>
<p>prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or</p>

<p>network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-</p>
<p>bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or</p>
<p>create an undue burden on the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Policy</strong></p>
<p>Twitter respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the</p>
<p>same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law</p>
<p>and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that</p>
<p>constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or</p>
<p>electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii)</p>
<p>identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the</p>
<p>material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be</p>

<p>locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an</p>
<p>email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the</p>
<p>manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a</p>
<p>statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you</p>
<p>are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>

<p>discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user’s account if the user is</p>
<p>determined to be a repeat infringer. Our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright</p>
