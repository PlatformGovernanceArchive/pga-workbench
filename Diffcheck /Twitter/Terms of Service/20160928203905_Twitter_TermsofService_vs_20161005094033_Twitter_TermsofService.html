<p>Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however,</p>
<p>scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part</p>
<p>of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-</p>
<p>identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including,</p>
<p>without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of</p>
<p>Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read,</p>
<p>preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal</p>
<p>process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent,</p>
