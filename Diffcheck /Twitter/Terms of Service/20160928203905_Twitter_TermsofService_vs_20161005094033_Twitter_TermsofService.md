Your Rights


Your Rights


You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your


Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).</span>


B<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">log</span> <span style="background-color: green;">submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such


Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). This license authorizes us to make your


Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to


provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other


companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content on


other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Twitter, or other


companies, organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you


submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.


Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to


enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed,


syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to


different media. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted


herein to any Content that you submit.


4. Using the Services


Please review the Twitter Rules, which are part of the User Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the Services. You may use


the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.


Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently


or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to


create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the


Services, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.


In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third-party providers and


partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services


whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing


them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may not do any of the following while


accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Twitter’s computer systems, or the


technical delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or


circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means


(automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only


pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with


Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however,


scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part


of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-


identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including,


without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of


Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read,


preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal


process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent,


or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or


safety of Twitter, its users and the public. Twitter does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in


accordance with our Privacy Policy.

(https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public), or Sign in with Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in), you agree to our


Developer Agreement (https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement) and Developer Policy


(https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy). If you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell,


transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Services or Content on the Services, you must use the


interfaces and instructions we provide, except as permitted through the Twitter Services, these Terms, or the terms provided on


dev.twitter.com.

(https://ads.twitter.com/terms).

Your Account


Your Account


You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong


password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to


comply with the above.


You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service


announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and


you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or


deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone


who acquires your old number.


Your License to Use the Services


Your License to Use the Services


Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to


you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as


provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.


The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Nothing in the


Terms gives you a right to use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand


features. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive


property of Twitter and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Twitter, or the Services is


entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to


you.


Ending These Terms


Ending These Terms


You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the


Services. See http://support.twitter.com/articles/15358-how-to-deactivate-your-account for instructions on how to deactivate your


account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens to your information.


We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason,


including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules, (ii) you create risk or


possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the


Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated


with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the


Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall


continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI.


5. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability


The Services are Available “AS-IS”


The Services are Available “AS-IS”


Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are


provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The “Twitter Entities” refers to Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related


companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors. Without limiting the foregoing, to the

Status</span> <span style="background-color: green;">ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS,</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The


Twitter Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy,



availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or


other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to


transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your


requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written,


obtained from the Twitter Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.


Limitation of Liability


Limitation of Liability


THE TWITTER ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE


DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA,


USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS


OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT


LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT


OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR


CONTENT. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON

ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS


FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.


SOME </span>J<span style="background-color: green;">URISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF IMPLIED


WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN THEIR ENTIRETIES, BUT WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM


EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
