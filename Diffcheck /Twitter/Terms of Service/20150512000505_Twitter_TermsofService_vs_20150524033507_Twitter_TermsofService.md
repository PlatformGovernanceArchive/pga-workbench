12. General Terms


A. Waiver and Severability


<span style="background-color: green;">A. Waiver and Severability


</span>The failure of Twitter to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the

you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.


If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally


unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S.


federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of


America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law,



the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).

Twitter Terms of Service


Effective


Effective: May 18, 2015


These Terms of Service (“Terms


Terms”) govern your access to and use of our Services, including our various websites, SMS, APIs, email


notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, commerce services (the “Twitter Services


Twitter Services”), and our other covered services that


link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services


Services”), and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded,


downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content


Content”). Your access to and use of the Services are


conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by


these Terms.


1. Basic Terms


You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. Most


Content you submit, post, or display through the Twitter Services is public by default and will be able to be viewed by other users


and through third party services and websites. Learn more here, and go to the account settings page to control who sees your


Content. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.


Tip


Tip : What you say on the Twitter Services may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!


You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Twitter and are not a person barred from receiving services


under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on


behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.


You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules


and regulations.


The Services that Twitter provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Twitter provides may change


from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Twitter may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or


any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain


the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.


The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made


through the Services, or any other information. The types and extent of advertising by Twitter on the Services are subject to


change. In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third party



providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from


the Services whether submitted by you or others.


2. Privacy


Any information that you or other users provide to Twitter is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of


your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the


Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States, Ireland, and/or other countries for


storage, processing and use by Twitter. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain


communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the


Services and your account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.


Tip


Tip : You can control most communications from the Twitter Services, including notifications about activity related to you, your


Tweets, Retweets, and network, and updates from Twitter. Please see your settings for email and mobile notifications for more.


 3. Passwords


You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your


password. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters,


numbers and symbols) with your account. Twitter cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to


comply with the above.


4. Content on the Services


All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content.


We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and, we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or


reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.

communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the


Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases,


postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Twitter be liable in any way for any


Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result


of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.


5. Your Rights


You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying


Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to


use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or


distribution methods (now known or later developed).

others do the same.

syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions


for such Content use.


Tip


Tip : Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Twitter Services. These


rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what’s yours is yours – you own your Content (and your


photos are part of that Content).



Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter, may be made with no


compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the


Services.

and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of


any networks, devices, services or media.

of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcast,


distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to


liability. Twitter will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Twitter in accordance with these Terms. You


represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content


that you submit.

Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any

Services, Twitter’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the


vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or


attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,


published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have

the Services.

(i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the


copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the
