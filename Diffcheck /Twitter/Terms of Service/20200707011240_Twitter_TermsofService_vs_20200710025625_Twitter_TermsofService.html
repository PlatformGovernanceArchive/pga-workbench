<p>Services.

<p>Policy for more information on what happens to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no</p>

<p>removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the</p>

<p>cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following</p>
<p>sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal</p>
<p>following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended). For the avoidance</p>
<p>of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation or termination of your account.</p>

<p>the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS,</p>
<p>WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or</p>
<p>information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Twitter Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or</p>
<p>representation not expressly made herein.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TWITTER ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY</p>
<p>INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES,</p>

<p>RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR</p>
<p>CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR</p>
<p>ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv)</p>

<p>THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TWITTER, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,</p>
<p>CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES</p>
<p>HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND</p>
<p>TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms,</p>
<p>which will always be at twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions,</p>
<p>for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the</p>
<p>Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises</p>
<p>between you and Twitter. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state</p>
<p>courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any</p>
<p>objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally</p>
<p>unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S.</p>
<p>federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of</p>
<p>America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law,</p>
<p>the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or</p>
<p>eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>

<p>retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to</p>
<p>distribute any Content on the Services, limit distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or terminate users,</p>
<p>and reclaim usernames without liability to you.</p>
<p>In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third-party providers</p>
<p>and partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the</p>
<p>Services whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them</p>
<p>or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may not do any of the</p>
<p>following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Twitter’s</p>
<p>computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any</p>
<p>system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access</p>
<p>or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces</p>
<p>that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically</p>
<p>allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with</p>
<p>the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited);</p>
<p>(iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the</p>
<p>Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do</p>
<p>so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming,</p>
<p>mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue</p>
<p>burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably</p>
<p>believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms,</p>
<p>including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical</p>
<p>issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Twitter, its users and the public.</p>
<p>Twitter does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
<p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a</p>
<p>strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your</p>
<p>failure to comply with the above.</p>
<p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as</p>
<p>service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your</p>
<p>account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you</p>
<p>later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from</p>
<p>communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.</p>
<p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided</p>
<p>to you as part of the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as</p>
<p>provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and other countries. Nothing in</p>
<p>the Terms gives you a right to use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive</p>
<p>brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by</p>
<p>users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Twitter and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you</p>
<p>may provide regarding Twitter, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or</p>
<p>suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>
<p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the</p>
<p>Services. See https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account (and for Periscope,</p>
<p>https://help.pscp.tv/customer/portal/articles/2460220) for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy</p>
<p>Policy for more information on what happens to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no</p>
<p>reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules and</p>
<p>Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be</p>
<p>removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the</p>
<p>Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address</p>
<p>associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such</p>
<p>cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following</p>
<p>sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal</p>
<p>following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended). For the avoidance</p>
<p>of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation or termination of your account.</p>
<p><strong>5. Limitations of Liability</strong></p>
<p>By using the Services you agree that Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents</p>
<p>representatives, partners and licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.</p>
<p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms,</p>
<p>which will always be at twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new</p>
<p>functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that</p>
<p>impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email</p>
<p>associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to</p>
<p>be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or</p>
<p>eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>These Terms are an agreement between you and Twitter International Company, an Irish company with its registered office at</p>
<p>One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact</p>
