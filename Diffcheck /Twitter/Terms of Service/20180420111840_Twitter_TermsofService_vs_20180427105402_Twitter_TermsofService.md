the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent


permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).


In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited


or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force


and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right


or provision.
