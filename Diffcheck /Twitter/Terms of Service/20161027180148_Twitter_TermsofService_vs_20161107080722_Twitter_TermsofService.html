<p>Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently</p>

<p>pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with</p>
<p>Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however,</p>
<p>scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part</p>
<p>of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-</p>
<p>identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including,</p>
<p>without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of</p>
<p>Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read,</p>

<p>process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent,</p>
<p>or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or</p>

<p>announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and</p>
<p>you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or</p>

<p>possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the</p>

<p>Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall</p>
<p>continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI.</p>
