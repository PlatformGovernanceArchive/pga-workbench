</ol>
<p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying</p>
<p>Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to</p>
<p>use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or</p>
<p>distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same.</p>
<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content</p>
<p>submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter for the</p>
<p>syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions</p>
<p>for such Content use.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip Twitter has an evolving set of rules (http://twitter.com/apirules) for how ecosystem partners can interact with your</p>
<p>Content. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what’s yours is yours – you own your</p>
<p>Content (and your photos are part of that Content).</p>
<p>Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter, may be made with no</p>
<p>compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the</p>
<p>Services.</p>
<p>We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media</p>
<p>and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of</p>
<p>any networks, devices, services or media.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use</p>
<p>of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcast,</p>
<p>distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to</p>
<p>liability. Twitter will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Twitter in accordance with these Terms. You</p>
<p>represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content</p>
<p>that you submit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your License To Use the Services</li>
</ol>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software that is</p>
<p>provided to you by Twitter as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit</p>
<p>of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<ol>

<p>the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, to suspend or</p>
<p>terminate users, and to reclaim usernames without liability to you. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose</p>

<p>attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,</p>
<p>published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been</p>
<p>specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly</p>
<p>prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use</p>
<p>the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do</p>
<p>so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-</p>
<p>bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on</p>
<p>the Services.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>Twitter respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to</p>
<p>notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that</p>
<p>your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information:</p>
<p>(i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the</p>
<p>copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the</p>
<p>subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient</p>
<p>to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</p>
<p>(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by</p>
<p>the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under</p>
<p>penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to</p>
<p>you. In appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer. Our</p>

<li>Ending These Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Twitter as follows.</p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time for any reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your</p>
<p>use of the Services. You do not need to specifically inform Twitter when you stop using the Services. If you stop using the Services</p>
<p>without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity under our Inactive Account</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason,</p>
<p>including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules, (ii) you create risk or</p>
<p>possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make</p>
<p>reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following</p>
<p>sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.</p>

<p>officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Twitter Entities”). Each of the</p>
<p>subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the</p>
<p>disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply</p>
<p>to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
<p>A. The Services are Available <span style="background-color: red;">“</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span>AS-IS<span style="background-color: red;">”</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span></p>

<p>applicable law, THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF</p>
<p>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

<p>FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF</p>
<p>ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT</p>
<p>OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE</p>

<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE TWITTER ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S.</p>
<p>DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TWITTER, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE</p>
<p>TO THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,</p>
<p>CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES HAVE</p>

<p>FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<ol>
<li>General Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Waiver and Severability</p>
<p>The failure of Twitter to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the</p>
<p>event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to</p>
<p>the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</p>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application</p>
<p>of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection</p>
<p>with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and</p>
<p>you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally</p>
<p>unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S.</p>
<p>federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of</p>
<p>America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law,</p>
<p>the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</p>
<p>C. Entire Agreement</p>
<p>These Terms, the Twitter Rules and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Twitter and you regarding</p>
<p>the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Twitter that is explicitly in addition or in place</p>
<p>of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Twitter and you regarding the Services.</p>
<p>Other than members of the group of companies of which Twitter, Inc. is the parent, no other person or company will be third party</p>
<p>beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at twitter.com/tos. If the revision, in our sole</p>
<p>discretion, is material we will notify you via an @Twitter update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing</p>

<p>questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>

<p>your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the</p>
<p>Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States, Ireland, and/or other countries for</p>
<p>storage, processing and use by Twitter. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain</p>
<p>communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the</p>
<p>Services and your account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : You can control most communications from the Twitter Services, including notifications about activity related to you, your</p>
<p>Tweets, Retweets, and network, and updates from Twitter. Please see your settings for email and mobile notifications for more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Passwords</li>
</ol>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your</p>
<p>password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters,</p>
<p>numbers and symbols) with your account. Twitter cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to</p>
<p>comply with the above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Content on the Services</li>
</ol>
<p>All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content.</p>
<p>We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and, we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or</p>
<p>reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.</p>
<p>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or</p>
<p>communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the</p>
<p>Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases,</p>
<p>postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Twitter be liable in any way for any</p>
<p>Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result</p>
<p>of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying</p>
<p>Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to</p>
<p>use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or</p>
<p>distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets on the Twitter Services available to the rest of the world and to let</p>
<p>others do the same.</p>
<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content</p>
<p>submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter for the</p>
<p>syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions</p>
<p>for such Content use.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Twitter Services. These</p>
<p>rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what's yours is yours – you own your Content (and your</p>
<p>photos are part of that Content).</p>
<p>Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter, may be made with no</p>
<p>compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the</p>
<p>Services.</p>
<p>We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media</p>
<p>and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of</p>
<p>any networks, devices, services or media.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use</p>
<p>of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcast,</p>
<p>distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to</p>
<p>liability. Twitter will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Twitter in accordance with these Terms. You</p>
<p>represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content</p>
<p>that you submit.</p>
<ol>

<p>attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,</p>
<p>published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have</p>
<p>been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly</p>
<p>prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use</p>

<p>so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-</p>
<p>bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on</p>
<p>the Services.</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>Twitter respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to</p>
<p>notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that</p>
<p>your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information:</p>
<p>(i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the</p>
<p>copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the</p>
<p>subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient</p>
<p>to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</p>
<p>(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by</p>
<p>the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under</p>
<p>penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to</p>
<p>you. In appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>

<li>Ending These Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Twitter as follows.</p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time for any or no reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing</p>
<p>your use of the Services. You do not need to specifically inform Twitter when you stop using the Services. If you stop using the</p>
<p>Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity under our Inactive</p>
<p>Account Policy.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no</p>
<p>reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules, (ii) you</p>
<p>create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will</p>
<p>make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access</p>
<p>your account.</p>
<p>In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following</p>
<p>sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall affect Twitter's rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as</p>
<p>provided above in section 1.</p>

<p>officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "Twitter Entities"). Each of the</p>
<p>subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the</p>
<p>disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply</p>
<p>to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
<p>A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are</p>
<p>provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under</p>
<p>applicable law, THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF</p>
<p>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>The Twitter Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness,</p>
<p>accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss</p>
<p>of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to</p>
<p>store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet</p>
<p>your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or</p>
<p>written, obtained from the Twitter Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made</p>
<p>herein.</p>

<p>responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or</p>
<p>available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Twitter Entities</p>
<p>of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole</p>
<p>responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

<p>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER</p>
<p>INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING</p>
<p>FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF</p>
<p>ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT</p>
<p>OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE</p>

<p>DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TWITTER, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE</p>
<p>TO THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,</p>
<p>CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES HAVE</p>
<p>BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE</p>
<p>FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<ol>
<li>General Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Waiver and Severability</p>
<p>A. Waiver and Severability</p>
<p>The failure of Twitter to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the</p>
<p>event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to</p>
<p>the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</p>
<p>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</p>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application</p>
<p>of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection</p>
<p>with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and</p>
<p>you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally</p>
<p>unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S.</p>
<p>federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of</p>

<p>between Twitter and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Twitter</p>
<p>that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between</p>
<p>Twitter and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Twitter, Inc. is the parent, no</p>
<p>other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at twitter.com/tos. If the revision, in our sole</p>
<p>discretion, is material we will notify you via an @Twitter update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing</p>
