<p>deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or</p>

<p><strong>4. Using the Services</strong></p>
<p>Please review the Twitter Rules and Policies (and, for Periscope, the Periscope Community Guidelines at https://pscp.tv/content), which are part of the User</p>
<p>Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the Services. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and</p>
<p>regulations.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the</p>
<p>Services or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time.</p>
<p>We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, <span style="background-color: red;">suspend or terminate users, and rec</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">a</span>im<span style="background-color: red;"> usernames w</span>it<span style="background-color: red;">hout</span> <span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">d</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">stri</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">ution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or terminate users, and</p>

<p>the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse our</p>
<p>Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may not do any</p>
<p>of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Twitter’s computer systems, or the technical</p>
<p>delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p>measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,</p>
<p>published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a</p>
<p>separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the</p>
<p>Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or</p>
<p>posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the</p>
<p>access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the</p>
<p>creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose</p>
<p>any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms,</p>
<p>including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support</p>
<p>requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Twitter, its users and the public. Twitter does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties</p>
<p>except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you use developer features of the Services, including but not limited to Twitter for Websites (https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview), Twitter Cards</p>
<p>(https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview), Public API (https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public), or Sign in with Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in), you</p>
<p>agree to our Developer Agreement (https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement) and Developer Policy (https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy). If</p>
<p>you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Services or Content</p>
<p>on the Services, you must use the interfaces and instructions we provide, except as permitted through the Twitter Services, these Terms, or the terms provided on</p>
<p>dev.twitter.com. If you are a security researcher, you are required to comply with the rules of the Twitter Vulnerability Reporting Program</p>
<p>(https://hackerone.com/twitter). The requirements set out in the preceding paragraph may not apply to those participating in Twitter’s Vulnerability Reporting</p>
<p>Program.</p>
<p>If you use advertising features of the Services, you must agree to our Twitter Master Services Agreement (https://ads.twitter.com/terms).</p>
<p>If you use Super Hearts, Coins, or Stars on Periscope, you agree to our Super Hearts Terms (https://legal.twitter.com/en/periscope/super/terms.html).</p>
<p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
<p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this</p>
<p>account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>
<p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and</p>
<p>administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If</p>
<p>you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent</p>
<p>us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.</p>
<p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This</p>
<p>license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and <span style="background-color: red;">f</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;">ign</span> countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the</p>
<p>Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and</p>
<p>to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Twitter and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions</p>
<p>you may provide regarding Twitter, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without</p>
<p>any obligation to you.</p>
<p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See</p>
<p>https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account (and for Periscope, https://help.pscp.tv/customer/portal/articles/2460220)</p>
<p>for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what happens to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we</p>
<p>reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules and Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal</p>
<p>exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision</p>
<p>of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next</p>
<p>time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to</p>
<p>use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal</p>
<p>following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended). For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the</p>
<p>deactivation or termination of your account.</p>
<p><strong>5. Limitations of Liability</strong></p>
<p>By using the Services you agree that Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents representatives, partners and licensors,</p>
<p>liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.</p>
<p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at twitter.com/tos,</p>
<p>will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making</p>
<p>effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email</p>
<p>associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent</p>
<p>necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be</p>
<p>deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>These Terms are an agreement between you and Twitter International Company, an Irish company with its registered office at One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street</p>
<p>Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>

<p>individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available</p>
<p>through the Services.</p>
<p>Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open</p>
<p>ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by</p>
<p>us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights</p>
<p>granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to</p>

<p>license described above.</p>

<p>“AS AVAILABLE” basis. The “Twitter Entities” refers to Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,</p>
<p>partners, and licensors. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE TWITTER ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL</p>
<p>WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-</p>
<p>INFRINGEMENT. The Twitter Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy,</p>

<p><strong>Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content</strong></p>
<p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your</p>
<p>incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered part of the Content).</p>
<p>By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to</p>
<p>sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution</p>
<p>methods (now known or later developed). This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same.</p>
<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the</p>
<p>Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content on</p>
<p>other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or</p>
<p>individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available</p>
<p>through the Services.</p>
<p>Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open</p>
<p>ecosystem with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by</p>
<p>us and our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights</p>
<p>granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to</p>
<p>copyright or other proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant Twitter the</p>
<p>license described above.</p>
<p><strong>4. Using the Services</strong></p>
<p>Please review the Twitter Rules and Policies (and, for Periscope, the Periscope Community Guidelines at https://pscp.tv/content), which are part of the User</p>
<p>Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the Services. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and</p>
<p>regulations.</p>
<p>Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing</p>
<p>the Services or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion</p>
<p>at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third-party providers and partners may place</p>
<p>advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others. You also</p>
<p>agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that</p>
<p>we provide. You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services,</p>
<p>Twitter’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Twitter’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or</p>
<p>breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or</p>
<p>otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Twitter (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and</p>
<p>conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge</p>
<p>any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false</p>
<p>source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with</p>
<p>or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is</p>
<p>necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential</p>
<p>violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights,</p>
<p>property or safety of Twitter, its users and the public. Twitter does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in accordance with</p>
<p>our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you use developer features of the Services, including but not limited to Twitter for Websites (https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview), Twitter Cards</p>
<p>(https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview), Public API (https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public), or Sign in with Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-</p>

<p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
<p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its</p>
<p>use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>
<p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and</p>
<p>administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving</p>
<p>them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information</p>
<p>to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.</p>
<p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services.</p>
<p>This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these</p>
<p>Terms.</p>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to</p>
<p>use the Twitter name or any of the Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. All right, title, and interest in and to the</p>
<p>Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Twitter and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or</p>
<p>suggestions you may provide regarding Twitter, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as</p>
<p>we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>
<p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Twitter at any time by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See</p>
<p>https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account (and for Periscope,</p>
<p>https://help.pscp.tv/customer/portal/articles/2460220) for instructions on how to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on</p>
<p>what happens to your information.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not</p>
<p>limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules and Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create</p>
<p>risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged</p>
<p>inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address</p>
<p>associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall</p>
<p>terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: II, III, V, and VI. If you</p>
<p>believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?</p>
<p>subtopic=suspended).</p>
<p><strong>5. Limitations of Liability</strong></p>
<p>By using the Services you agree that Twitter, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents representatives, partners and</p>
<p>licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.</p>
<p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at</p>
<p>twitter.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30</p>
<p>days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service</p>
<p>notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you</p>
<p>agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent</p>
<p>necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Twitter’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms</p>
<p>will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
