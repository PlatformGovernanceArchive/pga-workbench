<p>provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Twitter may stop (permanently or</p>
<p>temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not</p>
<p>be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole</p>
<p>discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

<p>queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Twitter on the</p>
<p>Services are subject to change. In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you</p>

<p>Tip</p>
<p>This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets available to the rest of the world and to let</p>
<p>others do the same. But what’s yours is yours – you own your content.</p>
<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to make such Content available to other companies,</p>
<p>organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of</p>
<p>such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how API developers can interact with your content. These rules</p>
<p>exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind.</p>
<p>Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter, may</p>
<p>be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or</p>
<p>otherwise make available through the Services.</p>
<p>We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in</p>
<p>various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any</p>
<p>requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof,</p>
<p>including the use of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content</p>
<p>may be rebroadcasted by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may</p>
<p>subject you to liability. Twitter will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Twitter in</p>
<p>accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority</p>
<p>necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.</p>
<p>Twitter gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the</p>
<p>software that is provided to you by Twitter as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling</p>
<p>you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Twitter, in the manner permitted by these Terms.</p>

<p>these Terms) to better understand what is prohibited on the Service. We also reserve the right to access, read,</p>
<p>preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law,</p>
<p>regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential</p>
<p>violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to</p>

<p>a separate agreement with Twitter (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the</p>
<p>provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly</p>
<p>prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or</p>
<p>in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere</p>
<p>with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of</p>
<p>Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Policy</strong></p>
<p>Twitter respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We</p>
<p>will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly</p>
<p>provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,</p>
<p>please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a</p>
<p>person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</p>
<p>(iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that</p>
<p>is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to</p>
<p>locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email</p>
<p>address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner</p>
<p>complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the</p>
<p>information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf</p>
<p>of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat</p>
<p>infringer. Our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement appearing on the Services</p>
<p>is:</p>
