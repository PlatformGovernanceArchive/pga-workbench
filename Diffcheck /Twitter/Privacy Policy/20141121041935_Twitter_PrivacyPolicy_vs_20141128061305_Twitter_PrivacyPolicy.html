<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Twitter instantly connects people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to them. Any registered user can send a Tweet, which is a message of</p>
<p>140 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Twitter collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Twitter receives your</p>
<p>information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, and commerce services (the</p>
<p>"<strong>Services</strong>" or "<strong>Twitter</strong>") and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use Twitter from our</p>
<p>website, post or receive Tweets via SMS, or access Twitter from an application such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android or TweetDeck. When</p>
<p>using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as</p>
<p>described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Twitter to use your</p>
<p>information in the United States and any other country where Twitter operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com or here.</p>
<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a Twitter account, you provide some personal information, such as your name,</p>
<p>username, password, and email address. In some cases, you may be required to provide your phone number, for example, to use Twitter via</p>
<p>SMS or to help us prevent spam, fraud, or abuse. Your name and username are listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and</p>
<p>in search results. Some Services, such as search and public user profiles, do not require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a</p>
<p>picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use</p>
<p>your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from</p>
<p>notifications from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our</p>
<p>website. We may use your contact information to help others find your Twitter account, including through third-party services and client</p>
<p>applications. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload</p>
<p>your address book so that we can help you find Twitter users you know or help other Twitter users find you. We may later make suggestions to</p>
<p>you and other users on Twitter based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts from Twitter at</p>
<p>any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your</p>
<p>Twitter account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between Twitter and that service, the other service may send us your</p>
<p>registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us</p>
<p>improve the Services, and is deleted from Twitter within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Twitter your account on the other service. Learn</p>
<p>more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.</p>
<p>Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and the</p>
<p>metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as</p>
<p>favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. We may use this information to customize the</p>
<p>content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it</p>
<p>from Twitter, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate</p>
<p>your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are</p>
<p>immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that</p>
<p>integrate Twitter content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for</p>
<p>trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what</p>
<p>you are making public.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location</p>
<p>when you set your trend location on Twitter.com or your computer or mobile device sends us location information. We may also use other data</p>
<p>from your device to determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP</p>
<p>address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to</p>
<p>improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.</p>
<p>Learn more about Twitter’s use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client</p>
<p>applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to</p>
<p>be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but</p>
<p>we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that</p>
<p>is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact</p>
<p>with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to</p>
<p>prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p>Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> When you use our Services, we may receive information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the</p>
<p>referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and</p>
<p>cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,</p>
<p>interact with our email notifications, use your Twitter account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website</p>
<p>that includes a Twitter button or widget. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with a link on our Services to a third-</p>
<p>party application, such as when you choose to install another application through Twitter. Twitter uses Log Data to provide, understand, and</p>
<p>improve our Services. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any</p>
<p>common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Widget Data:</strong> We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When</p>
<p>these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that</p>
<p>identifies your browser ("<strong>Widget Data</strong>"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget</p>
<p>Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as</p>
<p>suggestions for people to follow on Twitter and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or</p>
<p>device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend</p>
<p>it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the</p>
<p>other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Commerce Services:</strong> You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,</p>
<p>and billing address (collectively, "<strong>Payment Information</strong>"), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction on Twitter.</p>
<p>You may also provide your credit or debit card number to register for card-linked services, such as offers. To facilitate future purchases on</p>
<p>Twitter, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time</p>
<p>using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We</p>
<p>collect and store information created by your purchases made on Twitter ("<strong>Transaction Data</strong>"). If you register your credit or debit card with</p>
<p>Twitter for card-linked services, we receive information about the card transactions from a third-party payment services provider ("<strong>Registered</strong></p>
<p><strong>Card Data</strong>"). Transaction Data and Registered Card Data may include the merchant’s name and the date, time and amount of the transaction.</p>
<p>Twitter uses Registered Card Data to verify eligibility for card-linked services, and may also use Registered Card Data to limit the number of offers</p>
<p>available to you and keep track of your offers.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</strong> Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and</p>
<p>wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect</p>
<p>information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share</p>
<p>information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such</p>
<p>as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown</p>
<p>interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad</p>
<p>partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about your privacy options here and about how Twitter ads work here. We may also receive information</p>
<p>about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the</p>
<p>delivery of ads.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application</p>
<p>to access your Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share</p>
<p>your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the</p>
<p>condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment</p>
<p>Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate</p>
<p>dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards. We may</p>
<p>share your credit or debit card number with payment services providers, or third parties authorized by them, to monitor card transactions at</p>
<p>participating merchants and track redemption activity for the purposes of providing card-linked services.</p>
<p><strong>Sellers of Goods and Services:</strong> If you buy goods or services on Twitter, we may provide the seller, commerce provider or marketplace with your</p>
<p>name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order fulfilment and dispute</p>
<p>resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to</p>
<p>these third parties’ privacy policies for information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or</p>
<p>technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or</p>
<p>objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</strong> In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets,</p>
<p>your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and</p>
<p>our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information,</p>
<p>such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a</p>
<p>particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any</p>
<p>private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p>
<p>Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you</p>
<p>provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted.</p>
<p>When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your</p>
<p>account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which</p>
<p>can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Our Policy Towards Children</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your</p>
<p>consent, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become</p>
<p>aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's</p>
<p>account. You can find additional resources for parents and teens here.</p>
<p>EU Safe Harbor Framework</p>
<p>Twitter complies with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity,</p>
<p>access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of</p>
<p>Commerce website.</p>

<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always</p>
<p>be at https://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter</p>
