<p>changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly</p>
<p>for any changes.</p>
<p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended</p>
<p>by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to,</p>
<p>collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United</p>
<p>States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and</p>

<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available</p>
<p>through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if</p>
<p>you have one.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration</strong>. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be</p>
<p>required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Twitter. This happens in a</p>
<p>number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password,</p>
<p>email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to</p>
<p>include in your public profile.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information</strong> Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people in the Twitter</p>
<p>network to enable you to connect with people on Twitter, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide</p>
<p>additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if</p>
<p>you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better</p>
<p>identify yourself and find new friends and opportunities in the Twitter system. If you activate the mobile phone options per the</p>
<p>Terms of Service at www.twitter.com/tos, we will collect your cellular phone number account information. You will receive</p>
<p>notifications on your cellular phone account in a number of cases, such as when a Twitter member adds you as a friend or sends</p>
<p>you a message. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and</p>
<p>correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Contact Information</strong> In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information</p>
<p>about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to</p>
<p>receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the</p>
<p>communications.</p>
