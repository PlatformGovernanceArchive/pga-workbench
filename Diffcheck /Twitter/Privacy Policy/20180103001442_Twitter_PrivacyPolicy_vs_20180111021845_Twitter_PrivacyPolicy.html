<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Our Services instantly connect people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to them. For example, any</p>
<p>registered user of Twitter can send a Tweet, which is public by default, and can include a message of 140</p>
<p>characters or less and content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites,</p>
<p>SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and our other covered services that link</p>
<p>to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you</p>
<p>send us information when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application such as Twitter</p>
<p>for Mac, Twitter for Android, or TweetDeck. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection,</p>
<p>transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes</p>
<p>any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.</p>
<p>When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. If you live</p>
<p>in the United States, your information is controlled by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San</p>
<p>Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A. If you live outside the United States, the data controller responsible for your</p>
<p>information is Twitter International Company, an Irish company with its registered office at One Cumberland</p>
<p>Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07 Ireland. Despite this, you alone control and are responsible for the</p>
<p>posting of your Tweets and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of</p>
<p>Service and Twitter Rules.</p>
<p>Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the</p>
<p>United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and</p>
<p>data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those</p>
<p>in the country where you live. Learn more about our global operations and data transfer here.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please submit a request through our form,</p>
<p>available at https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> If you choose to create a Twitter account, you must provide us with some</p>
<p>personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On Twitter,</p>
<p>your name and username are always listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and</p>
<p>you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can create and manage multiple Twitter accounts. If</p>
<p>you use Digits by Twitter, the contact information you provide to log in is not public. Some of our product</p>
<p>features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter user profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s</p>
<p>website, do not require you to create an account.</p>
<p>What you share on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!</p>
<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number,</p>
<p>to customize your account or enable certain account features, for example, for login verification or Twitter via</p>
<p>SMS. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us.</p>
<p>We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help</p>
<p>prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and</p>
<p>client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you</p>
<p>receive from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained</p>
<p>within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your Discoverability privacy settings control whether</p>
<p>others can find you on Twitter by your email address or phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and</p>
<p>personalize your experience across our Services. For example, you may choose to upload and sync your</p>
<p>address book so that we can help you find and connect with users you know or help other users find and</p>
<p>connect with you. We may later personalize content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts</p>
<p>and Tweets for you and other users, based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your</p>
<p>imported address book contacts at any time by visiting your Contacts Dashboard</p>
<p>at https://twitter.com/settings/contacts_dashboard. If you email us, we may keep your message, email</p>
<p>address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to</p>
<p>your account on another service, the other service may send us information that you authorize for use in the</p>
<p>Services. This information may enable cross-posting or otherwise help us improve the Services, and is</p>
<p>deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the</p>
<p>other service.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and Other Public Information:</strong> Twitter is primarily designed to help you</p>
<p>share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through Twitter is information you are</p>
<p>asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile information such as a short biography, your</p>
<p>location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages</p>
<p>you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client application you</p>
<p>used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and</p>
<p>the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you Like or Retweet, and Periscope broadcasts you click or</p>
<p>otherwise engage with (such as by commenting or hearting) on Twitter. Twitter broadly and instantly</p>
<p>disseminates your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including search</p>
<p>engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and organizations such</p>
<p>as universities, public health agencies, and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and</p>
<p>insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should</p>
<p>think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what</p>
<p>topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the</p>
<p>Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features,</p>
<p>like protected Tweets, to make the information more private if you want. For certain profile information fields</p>
<p>we provide you with visibility settings to select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us</p>
<p>with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change</p>
<p>the language and time zone associated with your account at any time using your account settings, available</p>
<p>at https://twitter.com/settings/account.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications:</strong> We provide certain features that allow you to</p>
<p>communicate more privately. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with</p>
<p>other Twitter users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending</p>
<p>and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to</p>
<p>them. Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for</p>
<p>instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public. When you use</p>
<p>features like Direct Messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store,</p>
<p>and re-share the contents of your communications.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to</p>
<p>publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set</p>
<p>your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device,</p>
<p>such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your</p>
<p>mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features</p>
<p>of our Services, such as allowing you to Tweet with your location, and to improve and customize the Services,</p>
<p>for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to</p>
<p>follow. Learn more about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email</p>
<p>notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do</p>
<p>this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate</p>
<p>click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, Tweets, and non-public</p>
<p>communications like Direct Messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to</p>
<p>a http://t.co link.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage</p>
<p>data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as</p>
<p>searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer</p>
<p>or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you</p>
<p>interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services,</p>
<p>and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies,</p>
<p>some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to</p>
<p>place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable</p>
<p>cookies. You can control how we personalize your Twitter experience and ads by using your Personalization</p>
<p>and Data settings, which are available at https://twitter.com/personalization whether or not you have a Twitter</p>
<p>account. We respond to these settings rather than the Do Not Track browser option, which we no longer</p>
<p>support. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p><strong>Using Our Services:</strong> We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our</p>
<p>Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our websites,</p>
<p>sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party</p>
<p>website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service that includes Twitter</p>
<p>content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information</p>
<p>(including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when</p>
<p>you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as</p>
<p>when you choose to install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to make inferences, like</p>
<p>what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. You can learn</p>
<p>about the interests we have inferred about you from your activity on and off of Twitter in Your Twitter Data,</p>
<p>available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in</p>
<p>this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your</p>
<p>username, full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter for Web Data:</strong> We may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites</p>
<p>that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons. When you view our content on</p>
<p>these websites, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We never associate this</p>
<p>web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter handle, and we delete,</p>
<p>obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other information that we</p>
<p>derive from this data to improve our Services and personalize content for you, such as suggestions for people</p>
<p>to follow, advertising, and other content you may be interested in. You can see and control interests that we</p>
<p>use to personalize your experience in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. You</p>
<p>can also control whether we keep track of your visits to websites with Twitter content by using your</p>
<p>Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help</p>
<p>recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. We do not use the content you share privately in</p>
<p>Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads</p>
<p>based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Twitter adheres</p>
<p>to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred</p>
<p>to as “interest-based advertising”). If you prefer, you can opt out of interest-based advertising by unchecking</p>
<p>Personalize Ads in your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization or</p>
<p>through the DAA’s consumer choice tool at https://optout.aboutads.info. We will not use information from the</p>
<p>browser (and for logged in users, the account) on which you opt out for interest-based advertising, and that</p>
<p>browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based ads from Twitter. Learn more about your</p>
<p>privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our Services here.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Twitter</p>
<p>users, partners (including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or</p>
<p>disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo.</p>
<p>Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo. Our ad partners and affiliates may share information</p>
<p>with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as</p>
<p>demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners,</p>
<p>particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by</p>
<p>integrating our advertising technology.</p>
<p><strong>Personalizing Across Your Devices:</strong> When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will</p>
<p>associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, we may also personalize your experience on, and based on information from,</p>
<p>other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into Twitter. For example, if you visit websites with</p>
<p>sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android. You can control</p>
<p>whether we link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log into Twitter (or if</p>
<p>you’re logged out, whether we link the browser or device you’re currently using to any other devices) through</p>
<p>your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p><strong>User Consent or Direction:</strong> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you</p>
<p>authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your</p>
<p>feedback with a business. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party application,</p>
<p>you are directing us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. If</p>
<p>you’ve shared information, like Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses</p>
<p>Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party</p>
<p>service.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the</p>
<p>United States, Ireland, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help</p>
<p>provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the</p>
<p>use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such</p>
<p>service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate</p>
<p>confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal</p>
<p>data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your</p>
<p>credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment services</p>
<p>providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances</p>
<p>described here.</p>
<p>dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of</p>
<p>credit or debit cards.</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose</p>
<p>your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process,</p>
<p>or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or</p>
<p>to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any</p>
<p>legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to</p>
<p>disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</strong> In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,</p>
<p>reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information</p>
<p>about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our</p>
<p>affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p><strong>Public Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile</p>
<p>information, public Tweets, or the people you follow or that follow you. Remember: your privacy and visibility</p>
<p>settings control whether your Tweets and certain profile information are made public. Other information, like</p>
<p>your name and username, is always public on Twitter, unless you delete your account, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:</strong> We may share or disclose non-personal,</p>
<p>aggregated, or device-level information such as the total number of times people engaged with a Tweet, the</p>
<p>number of users who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the</p>
<p>characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that people are</p>
<p>Tweeting about in a particular location, or aggregated or device-level reports to advertisers about users who</p>
<p>saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, phone number, or</p>
<p>Twitter handle. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through</p>
<p>partnerships with entities that may use data in their possession (including data you may have given them) to</p>
<p>link your name, email address, or other personal information to the information we provide them. These</p>
<p>partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so. You can control whether Twitter shares your</p>
<p>information under these partnerships by using your Personalization and Data settings, available</p>
<p>at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct,</p>
<p>delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can</p>
<p>download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here. You can learn</p>
<p>more about the interests we have inferred about you in Your Twitter Data and request access to additional</p>
<p>information here.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be</p>
<p>deactivated and then deleted. When deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public</p>
<p>profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your</p>
<p>account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us</p>
<p>to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our</p>
<p>systems, which can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like</p>
<p>your user profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter</p>
<p>Services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.</p>
<p>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>To bring you the Services, we operate globally. Twitter, Inc. complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy</p>
<p>Shield principles (the “Principles”) regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information</p>
<p>from the European Union and Switzerland, as described in our EU-US Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-</p>
<p>US Privacy Shield certification.</p>
<p>If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us here. As part of our participation in Privacy</p>
<p>Shield, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through</p>
<p>our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the independent dispute resolution</p>
<p>body JAMS, and under certain conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.</p>
<p>Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade</p>
<p>Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable</p>
<p>for the transfer of personal information from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU and</p>
<p>Switzerland. Learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield here.</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use</p>
<p>of your information and will always be at https://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in</p>
<p>our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter update or email to the email address</p>
<p>associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become</p>
<p>effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
