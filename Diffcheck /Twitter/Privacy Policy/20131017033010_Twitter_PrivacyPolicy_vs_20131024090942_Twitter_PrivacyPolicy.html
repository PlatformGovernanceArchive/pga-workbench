<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Twitter instantly connects people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to them. Any registered user can send a Tweet, which is a message of</p>
<p>140 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Twitter collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Twitter receives your</p>
<p>information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, <span style="background-color: red;">and </span>widget<span style="background-color: green;">s, and ad</span>s (the "<strong>Services</strong>" or "<strong>Twitter<span style="background-color: green;"></strong>")</p>
<p>and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use Twitter from our website, post or receive</p>
<p>Tweets via SMS, or access Twitter from an application such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android or TweetDeck. When using any of our</p>
<p>Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Twitter to use your information in the United States</p>
<p>and any other country where Twitter operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com or here.</p>
<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a Twitter account, you provide some personal information, such as</p>
<p>your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our</p>
<p>Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not</p>
<p>require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a</p>
<p>picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use</p>
<p>your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from</p>
<p>notifications from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our</p>
<p>website. We may use your contact information to help others find your Twitter account, including through third-party services and client</p>
<p>applications. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload</p>
<p>your address book so that we can help you find Twitter users you know. We may later suggest people to follow on Twitter based on your</p>
<p>imported address book contacts, which you can delete from Twitter at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and</p>
<p>contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your Twitter account to your account on another service in order to cross-post</p>
<p>between Twitter and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that</p>
<p>you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Twitter within a few weeks of your</p>
<p>disconnecting from Twitter your account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is</p>
<p>entirely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.</p>
<p>Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and the</p>
<p>metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as</p>
<p>favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the</p>
<p>information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Twitter, but we generally give you settings to make the information more</p>
<p>private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public</p>
<p>Tweets may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services, with</p>
<p>one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives Tweets for historical purposes. When you share information or content</p>
<p>like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location</p>
<p>when you set your trend location on Twitter.com or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set your</p>
<p>Tweet location preferences in your account settings and learn more about this feature here. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences</p>
<p>here. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to</p>
<p>improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client</p>
<p>applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to</p>
<p>be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but</p>
<p>we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data</p>
<p>file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you</p>
<p>interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our</p>
<p>Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting</p>
<p>cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable</p>
<p>cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information</p>
<p>such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and</p>
<p>application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our</p>
<p>websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Twitter account to authenticate to a third-party website or</p>
<p>application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. Twitter uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure,</p>
<p>customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or</p>
<p>remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Widget Data:</strong> We may tailor content for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these</p>
<p>websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your</p>
<p>browser ("<strong>Widget Data</span></strong>"). <span style="background-color: green;">Aft</span><span style="background-color: red;">For</p>

<p>removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other</p>
<p>information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of</span> this Privacy Policy<span style="background-color: red;">. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply</p>

<p><strong>Third-Parties:</strong> Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help</p>
<p>us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your</p>
<p>browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser</p>
<p>cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For</p>
<p>example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in Twitter</p>
<p>account</span> settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about this setting and</p>
<p>your additional Do Not Track browser option here.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application</p>
<p>to access your Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share</p>
<p>your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the</p>
<p>condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or</p>
<p>technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or</p>
<p>objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information</p>
<p>may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information,</p>
<p>such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a</p>
<p>particular link (even if only one did).</p>
<p>Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you</p>
<p>provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted.</p>
<p>When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your</p>
<p>account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which</p>
<p>can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Our Policy Towards Children</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your</p>
<p>consent, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become</p>
<p>aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's</p>
