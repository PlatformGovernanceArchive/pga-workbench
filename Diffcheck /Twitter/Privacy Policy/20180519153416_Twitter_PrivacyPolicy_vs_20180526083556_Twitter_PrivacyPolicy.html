<p><strong>how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the</strong></p>
<p><strong>information that you share with us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That’s the basic purpose of</span> this Privacy Policy<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information You Share With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>We require certain information to provide our services to you. For</strong></p>
<p><strong>example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content</strong></p>
<p><strong>on Twitter. When you choose to share the information below with us,</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect and use it to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles</p>
<p>or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some</p>
<p>personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter</p>
<p></span>M<span style="background-color: red;">ay</span><span style="background-color: green;">oments”),</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display</p>
<p>name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also </p>
<p>, for example to express different parts of your identity.</p>
<p>create and</p>
<p>manage multiple Twitter accounts</p>
<p><strong>1.</span>2<span style="background-color: red;">5th,</span><span style="background-color: green;"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Public</span> <span style="background-color: red;">20</span><span style="background-color: green;">Information</strong></p>
<p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your </p>
<p>, your time zone and language, when you created your</p>
<p>account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter</p>
<p>you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create,</p>
<p>people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. Periscope broadcasts you create, click</p>
<p>on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So are</p>
<p>your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you</p>
<p>watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast</p>
<p>will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who</p>
<p>use our services may also be public. For example, other people may </p>
<p>(if your settings allow) or mention you</p>
<p>in a Tweet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully</p>
<p>about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as</p>
<p>by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and</p>
<p>Twitter for Android.</p>
<p>In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter, we also use technology like application</p>
<p>programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for</p>
<p>example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content</p>
<p>available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern</p>
<p>how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not</p>
<p>affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we</p>
<p>make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.</p>

<p>Our Services inst</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ntly connect people everywhere to what's most meaningful to them. For example, any registered user of Twitter can send a Tweet, which is</p>
<p>public by default, and can include a message of 140 characters or less and content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p>What you share on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites,</span> SMS<span style="background-color: green;">)</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> and to send you information about our</p>
<p>services. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your</p>
<p>country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help</p>
<p>others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. You can use</p>
<p>your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter. You can also unsubscribe</p>
<p>from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>
<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you</p>
<p>know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your</p>
<p>Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,</p>
<p>friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.</p>
<p>You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>
<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to</p>
<p>profile information</p>
<p>tag you in a photo</p>
<p>your request.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications</strong></p>
<p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can</p>
<p>use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on</p>
<p>Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your</p>
<p>communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to</p>
<p>http://t.co URLs, </p>
<p>and prohibited images, and review of reported issues. We also use information about</p>
<p>whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of</p>
<p>our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of</p>
<p>your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a</p>
<p>way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,</p>
<p>those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that </p>
<p>of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -</p>
<p>which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>
<p><strong>1.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
<p>You may provide us with </p>
<p>, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,</p>
<p>and billing address, in order to purchase advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services.</p>
<p><strong>1.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>How You Control the Information You Share with Us</strong></p>
<p>Your Privacy and safety settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether your Tweets are publicly available on Twitter</p>
<p>Whether others can tag you in a photo</p>
<p>Whether you will be able to receive Direct Messages from anyone on Twitter or just your followers</p>
<p>Whether others can find you based on your email or phone number</p>
<p>Whether you upload your address book to Twitter for storage and use</p>
<p>When and where you may see sensitive content on Twitter</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information We Receive About You</strong></p>
<p><strong>We receive certain information when you use our services or other</strong></p>
<p><strong>websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from</strong></p>
<p><strong>third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with</strong></p>
<p><strong>us, we use the data below to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
<p>We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device</p>
<p>settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current</p>
<p>precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more</p>
<p>relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location</p>
<p>here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope</p>
<p>broadcasts here.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails</p>
<p>we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.</p>
<p>If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from</p>
<p>Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it</p>
<p>was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and</p>
<p>similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many</p>
<p>parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept</p>
<p>cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to </p>
<p>. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device</p>
<p>allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to</p>
<p>monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account</p>
<p>security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not</p>
<p>support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”</p>
<p>even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our</p>
<p>email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter</p>
<p>content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and</p>
<p>application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links</p>
<p>on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to operate our services and</p>
<p>ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to</p>
<p>determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences</p>
<p>like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better design our</p>
<p>services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter for Web Data</strong></p>
<p>When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet</p>
<p>buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the</p>
<p>use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We</p>
<p>do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,</p>
<p>obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be</p>
<p>located in the European Union or EFTA States.</p>
<p>place a cookie on</p>
<p>your computer</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers and Other Ad Partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to</p>
<p>help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you</p>
<p>ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device</p>
<p>IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of</p>
<p>our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by</p>
<p>integrating our advertising technology.</p>
<p>Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred</p>
<p>to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based</p>
<p>advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on</p>
<p>categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more</p>
<p>about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising</p>
<p>services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>

<p><strong>2.8</strong></p>
<p><strong>O</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">her Third Parties and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners</p>
<p>who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you</span> link to<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us</p>
<p>information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting</p>
<p>or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke</p>
<p>this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have</p>
<p>connected to Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>2.9</strong></p>
<p><strong></span>P<span style="background-color: green;">ers</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">na</span>li<span style="background-color: green;">zing A</span>c<span style="background-color: green;">ross Your Devices</strong></p>
<p>When </span>y<span style="background-color: green;">ou log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes</p>
<p>such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with</p>
<p>browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter</span> (<span style="background-color: red;">c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">lle</span><span style="background-color: green;">r asso</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">t</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">v</span><span style="background-color: green;">at</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>y<span style="background-color: green;">our logged-out device or browser with other</p>
<p>browsers or devices). We do this to operate and personalize our services. For example</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> if you visit websites with sports content</p>
<p>on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android.</p>
<p><strong>2.10</strong></p>
<p><strong>How You Control Additional Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p>Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter</p>
<p>How we personalize your experience across devices</p>
<p>Whether we collect and use your precise location</p>
<p>Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been</p>
<p>Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content</p>
<p>You can use Your Twitter data to review:</p>
<p>Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads</p>
<p>Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners</p>
<p>Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests</p>
<p>We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.</p>
<p>This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account</p>
<p>that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch</p>
<p>history through your settings.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Share and Disclose</strong></p>
<p><strong>As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly</strong></p>
<p><strong>disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the</strong></p>
<p><strong>limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we</strong></p>
<p><strong>do so subject to your control, because it’s necessary to operate our</strong></p>
<p><strong>services, or because it’s required by law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing You Control</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web</p>
<p>client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared</p>
<p>information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,</p>
<p>keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For</p>
<p>example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of</p>
<p>our advertising business. We also share device identifiers, along with the interests or other characteristics of a device or the</p>
<p>person using it, to help partners decide whether to serve an ad to that device or to enable them to conduct marketing, brand</p>
<p>analysis, interest-based advertising, or similar activities. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and</p>
<p>you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in this way by using</span> the “S<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">ha</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">vic</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> your data with Twitter’s business</p>
<p>partner</span>s”<span style="background-color: green;"> option in your Personalization and Data settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our</p>
<p>Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our service providers.</span>)<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">T</span><span style="background-color: red;">and from our partners and ot</span>he<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: red;">th</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">nfo</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">d p</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>ti<span style="background-color: green;">on w</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>s<span style="background-color: green;">hare with these partners does not</p>

<p>we share to be linked to other personal information if the partner gets your consent first</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries.</p>
<p></span>For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>example, <span style="background-color: red;">you send us information </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">n</span> <span style="background-color: red;">yo</span>u<span style="background-color: red;"> u</span>se <span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;">our</span> <span style="background-color: green;">variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis,</p>
<p>and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with</p>
<p>such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and</p>
<p>security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant</p>
<p>to our instructions. We share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent,</p>
<p>detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for</p>
<p>other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve,</p>
<p>use, or disclose your personal data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process,</p>
<p>or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to</p>
<p>help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to </p>
<p>; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of</p>
<p>those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that</p>
<p>you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and Change of Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may</p>
<p>be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our</p>
<p>affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>

<p>people are Tweeting about in a particular location, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their</p>

<p>vary from those in the country where you live. Learn more about our global operations and data transfer here.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services.</p>
<p>Basic Account Information: If you choose to create a Twitter account, you must provide us with some personal information, such as your name, username,</p>
<p>password, email address, or phone number. On Twitter, your name and username are always listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search</p>
<p>results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can create and manage multiple Twitter accounts. If you use Digits by Twitter, the</p>
<p>contact information you provide to log in is not public. Some of our product features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter user profiles or watching</p>
<p>a broadcast on Periscope’s website, do not require you to create an account.</p>
<p>Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable certain</p>
<p>account features, for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to</p>
<p>that number from us. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or</p>
<p>abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile</p>
<p>notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within</p>
<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>the notification or the instructions on our website. Your Discoverability privacy settings control whether others can find you on Twitter by your email</p>
<p>address or phone number.</p>
<p>Additional Information: You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and personalize your experience across our Services. For</p>
<p>example, you may choose to upload and sync your address book so that we can help you find and connect with users you know or help other users find and</p>
<p>connect with you. We may later personalize content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts and Tweets for you and other users, based on</p>
<p>imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time by visiting your Contacts Dashboard at https://twitter</p>
<p>.com/settings/contacts_dashboard. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you</p>
<p>connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, the other service may send us information that you authorize for use in the</p>
<p>Services. This information may enable cross-posting or otherwise help us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your</p>
<p>disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service.</p>
<p>Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and Other Public Information: Twitter is primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the</p>
<p>information you provide us through Twitter is information you are asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile information such as a short</p>
<p>biography, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages you Tweet; the metadata</p>
<p>provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client application you used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation time,</p>
<p>language, country, and time zone; and the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you Like or Retweet, and Periscope broadcasts you click or otherwise</p>
<p>engage with (such as by commenting or hearting) on Twitter. Twitter broadly and instantly disseminates your public information to a wide range of users,</p>
<p>customers, and services, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and organizations such as</p>
<p>universities, public health agencies, and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content</p>
<p>like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make</p>
<p>inferences, like what topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as</p>
<p>long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like protected Tweets, to make the information more private if you want. For</p>
<p>certain profile information fields we provide you with visibility settings to select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us with profile</p>
<p>information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change the language and time zone associated with your account at</p>
<p>any time using your account settings, available at https://twitter.com/settings/account.</p>
<p>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications: We provide certain features that allow you to communicate more privately. For example, you can use</p>
<p>Direct Messages to have private conversations with other Twitter users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by</p>
<p>sending and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to them. Please note that if you interact</p>
<p>with public Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public.</p>
<p>When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your</p>
<p>communications.</p>
<p>Location Information: We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your</p>
<p>Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data</p>
<p>from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP</p>
<p>address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as allowing you to Tweet with your location, and to</p>
<p>improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more</p>
<p>about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p>Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications,</p>
<p>by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share</p>
<p>aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, Tweets, and non-public communications like Direct Messages</p>
<p>shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to a http://t.co link.</p>
<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not</p>
<p>require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your</p>
<p>computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor</p>
<p>aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers</p>
<p>automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on</p>
<p>your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. You can control how we personalize your Twitter experience and</p>
<p>ads by using your Personalization and Data settings, which are available at https://twitter.com/personalization whether or not you have a Twitter account.</p>
<p>We respond to these settings rather than the Do Not Track browser option, which we no longer support. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar</p>
<p>technologies here.</p>
<p>Using Our Services: We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log</p>
<p>Data”). For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-</p>
<p>party website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about</p>
<p>you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device</p>
<p>information (including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with</p>
<p>links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to</p>
<p>make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. You can learn about the interests we</p>
<p>have inferred about you from your activity on and off of Twitter in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. We keep Log Data as</p>
<p>needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username,</p>
<p>full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Twitter for Web Data: We may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded</p>
<p>timelines or Tweet buttons. When you view our content on these websites, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We never</p>
<p>associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter handle, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no</p>
<p>longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other information that we derive from this data to improve our Services and personalize content for you, such</p>
<p>as suggestions for people to follow, advertising, and other content you may be interested in. You can see and control interests that we use to personalize</p>
<p>your experience in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. You can also control whether we keep track of your visits to</p>
<p>websites with Twitter content by using your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p>Advertising: Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more</p>
<p>relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. We do not use the content you share</p>
<p>privately in Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider sensitive,</p>
<p>such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral</p>
<p>Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”). If you prefer, you can opt out of interest-based advertising by unchecking Personalize Ads in</p>
<p>your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization or through the DAA’s consumer choice tool at https://optout</p>
<p>.aboutads.info. We will not use information from the browser (and for logged in users, the account) on which you opt out for interest-based advertising,</p>
<p>and that browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based ads from Twitter. Learn more about your privacy options for interest-based ads</p>
<p>here and about how ads work on our Services here.</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates: We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Twitter users, partners (including ad partners), or our</p>
<p>corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you</p>
<p>in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo. Our ad partners and affiliates may share information with us such as a browser cookie</p>
<p>ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or</p>
<p>app. Our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our</p>
<p>advertising technology.</p>
<p>Personalizing Across Your Devices: When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for</p>
<p>purposes such as authentication and personalization. Depending on your settings, we may also personalize your experience on, and based on information</p>
<p>from, other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into Twitter. For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may</p>
<p>show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android. You can control whether we link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log</p>
<p>into Twitter (or if you’re logged out, whether we link the browser or device you’re currently using to any other devices) through your Personalization and</p>
<p>Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application</p>
<p>to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party</p>
<p>application, you are directing us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. If you’ve shared information, like</p>
<p>Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared</p>
<p>with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. For</p>
<p>example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and</p>
<p>improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to</p>
<p>obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties</p>
<p>use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your credit or debit card</p>
<p>number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or</p>
<p>other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or</p>
<p>debit cards.</p>
<p>Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security</p>
<p>or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or</p>
<p>objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information</p>
<p>may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also</p>
<p>disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services,</p>
<p>including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p>Public Information: We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, or the people you follow</p>
<p>or that follow you. Remember: your privacy and visibility settings control whether your Tweets and certain profile information are made public. Other</p>
<p>information, like your name and username, is always public on Twitter, unless you delete your account, as described below.</p>
<p>Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information: We may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information such as the total</p>
<p>number of times people engaged with a Tweet, the number of users who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the</p>
<p>characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, or aggregated or</p>
<p>device-level reports to advertisers about users who saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, phone number,</p>
<p>or Twitter handle. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through partnerships with entities that may use data in</p>
<p>their possession (including data you may have given them) to link your name, email address, or other personal information to the information we provide</p>
<p>them. These partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so. You can control whether Twitter shares your information under these</p>
<p>partnerships by using your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you</p>
<p>provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the interests we have inferred about you in Your Twitter Data and request access to additional information here.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When</p>
<p>deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still</p>
<p>possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us to extend your</p>
<p>deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information and public</p>
<p>Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.</p>
<p><strong>Our Global Operations</strong></p>
<p>To bring you the Services, we operate globally. Twitter, Inc. complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles (the “Principles”) regarding the</p>
<p>collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland, as described in our EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
<p>certification and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certification.</p>
<p>If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us here. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if you have a dispute with us about our</p>
<p>adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the independent dispute</p>
<p>resolution body JAMS, and under certain conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.</p>
<p>You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you take away from it:</p>
<p>Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory</p>
<p>bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal information from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside</p>
<p>the EU and Switzerland. Learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield here.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter update or email to</p>
<p>the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by</p>
<p>the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to</p>
<p>empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.</p>
<p>That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong></span>I<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>f<span style="background-color: red;">ormation</span> <span style="background-color: red;">You Share With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>We require certain information to provide our services to </span>you<span style="background-color: red;">.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">For ex</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">mple, you must have an account in o</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">der to upload or share content on</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter. When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p>1.1</p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s</p>
<p>website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a</p>
<p>display name (for example, “Twitter Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display</p>
<p>name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also </p>
<p>, for</p>
<p>example to express different parts of your identity.</p>
<p>1.2</p>
<p><strong>Public Information</strong></p>
<p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your </p>
<p>, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Tweets and certain</p>
<p>information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your</p>
<p>Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. Periscope broadcasts you</p>
<p>create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So are your hearts, comments, the</p>
<p>number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other</p>
<p>content you contribute to another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by</p>
<p>other people who use our services may also be public. For example, other people may </p>
<p>(if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if</p>
<p>it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated</p>
<p>content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android.</p>
<p>In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter, we also use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds</p>
<p>to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on</p>
<p>Twitter. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern</p>
<p>how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings</p>
<p>may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit</p>
<p>https://developer.twitter.com.</p>
<p>1.3</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information and Address Books</strong></p>
<p>We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help</p>
<p>prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to personalize our services, enable certain account features (for example, for login verification or</p>
<p>Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our services. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that</p>
<p>number as your country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if</p>
<p>create and manage multiple Twitter accounts</p>
<p>profile information</p>
<p>tag you in a photo</p>
<p>your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control</p>
<p>notifications you receive from Twitter. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>
<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect</p>
<p>with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.</p>
<p>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your Periscope account to these other services. If</p>
<p>you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address, friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to</p>
<p>recommend your account or content to others. You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>
<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.</p>
<p>1.4</p>
<p><strong>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications</strong></p>
<p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have non-public</p>
<p>conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages,</p>
<p>we will store and process your communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co</p>
<p>URLs, </p>
<p>and prohibited images, and review of reported issues. We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but</p>
<p>not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant</p>
<p>content. We share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a way</p>
<p>that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet, those interactions will be public. When you use</p>
<p>features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that </p>
<p>of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of</p>
<p>those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>
<p>1.5</p>
<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
<p>You may provide us with </p>
<p>, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address, in order to purchase</p>
<p>advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services.</p>
<p>1.6</p>
<p><strong>How You Control the Information You Share with Us</strong></p>
<p>Your Privacy and safety settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether your Tweets are publicly available on Twitter</p>
<p>Whether others can tag you in a photo</p>
<p>Whether you will be able to receive Direct Messages from anyone on Twitter or just your followers</p>
<p>Whether others can find you based on your email or phone number</p>
<p>Whether you upload your address book to Twitter for storage and use</p>
<p>When and where you may see sensitive content on Twitter</p>
<p>Whether you want to block or mute other Twitter accounts</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information We Receive About You</strong></p>
<p><strong>We receive certain information when you use our services or other websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from third parties</strong></p>
<p><strong>including advertisers. Like the information you share with us, we use the data below to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p>2.1</p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
<p>We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device settings, to securely and reliably set up</p>
<p>and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current precise position or places where you’ve</p>
<p>previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to</p>
<p>follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in</p>
<p>Periscope broadcasts here.</p>
<p>2.2</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails we send you and links in Tweets that</p>
<p>appear on other websites or mobile applications.</p>
<p>If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from Twitter or Periscope, along with other</p>
<p>information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you,</p>
<p>such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.</p>
<p>2.3</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional</p>
<p>website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although</p>
<p>most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to </p>
<p>. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session</p>
<p>cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise</p>
<p>operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We</p>
<p>do not support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>2.4</p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account.</p>
<p>For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit</p>
<p>a third-party service that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and</p>
<p>cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through</p>
<p>Twitter. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of</p>
<p>accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be interested</p>
<p>in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p>2.5</p>
<p><strong>Twitter for Web Data</strong></p>
<p>When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons, we may receive Log Data that</p>
<p>includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to</p>
<p>show more relevant content, including ads. We do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we</p>
<p>delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to b</span>e located in the European Union or EFTA<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>advertising technology.</p>
<p>Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”) and</p>
<p>respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit</p>
<p>advertisers from targeting ads based on categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more</p>
<p>about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising services. You can update your data in your</p>
<p>Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.7</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>
<p>If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your data by contacting us directly as</p>
<p>described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.8</p>
<p><strong>Other Third Parties and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality</p>
<p>of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your Twitter account.</p>
<p>You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.</p>
<p>We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter</p>
<p>formally supports, you may revoke this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have connected</p>
<p>to Twitter.</p>
<p>2.9</p>
<p><strong>Personalizing Across Your Devices</strong></p>
<p>When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication, security, and</p>
<p>personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your</p>
<p>logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices</span>). <span style="background-color: green;">You must be at least 16 years of age to use Periscope.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Share and Disclose</strong></p>
<p><strong>As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the limited</strong></p>
<p><strong>circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we do so subject to your control, because it’s necessary to operate our services, or</strong></p>
<p><strong>because it’s required by law.</strong></p>
<p>3.1</p>
<p><strong>Sharing You Control</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your</p>
<p>account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who</p>
<p>accesses Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For example, we share with advertisers the</p>
<p>identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of our advertising business. We also share device identifiers, along with the</p>
<p>interests or other characteristics of a device or the person using it, to help partners decide whether to serve an ad to that device or to enable them to conduct</p>
<p>marketing, brand analysis, interest-based advertising, or similar activities. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control</p>
<p>whether Twitter shares your personal data in this way by using the “Share your data with Twitter’s business partners” option in your Personalization and Data settings.</p>
<p>(This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our service providers.) The information we share</p>
<p>with these partners does not include your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter username, but some of these partnerships allow the information we share</p>
<p>to be linked to other personal information if the partner gets your consent first.</p>
<p>3.2</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-</p>
