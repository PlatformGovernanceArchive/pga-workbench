<p>We have made revisions to this Privacy Policy, effective June 18th, 2017. You can see the new Privacy Policy here. By continuing to</p>
<p>use our services after June 18th, you agree to this new Privacy Policy. A summary of changes can be found on our Help Center.</p>
<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Our Services instantly connect people everywhere to what's most meaningful to them. For example, any registered user of Twitter</p>
<p>can send a Tweet, which is public by default, and can include a message of 140 characters or less and content like photos, videos,</p>
<p>and links to other websites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use and share your information across our websites, SMS, APIs, email</p>
<p>notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads, commerce services, and our other covered services that link to this Policy</p>
<p>(collectively, the "Services"), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our</p>
<p>Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android or TweetDeck. When using any of</p>
<p>our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.</p>
<p>When this policy mentions "we" or "us," it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. If you live in the United</p>
<p>States, your information is controlled by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A. If you live</p>
<p>outside the United States, the data controller responsible for your information is Twitter International Company, an Irish company</p>
<p>with its registered office at The Academy, 42 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. Despite this, you alone control and are responsible</p>
<p>for the posting of your Tweets and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service and Twitter</p>
<p>Rules.</p>
<p>Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States, Ireland,</p>
<p>and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding</p>
<p>when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live.</p>

<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Basic Account Information:</p>
<p>Basic Account Information: If you choose to create a Twitter account, you must provide us with some personal information,</p>
<p>such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On Twitter, your name and username are listed publicly,</p>
<p>including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can create and</p>
<p>manage multiple Twitter accounts. If you use Digits by Twitter, the contact information you provide to log in is not public. Some of</p>
<p>our product features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter user profiles or watching a Periscope broadcast on Twitter, do</p>
<p>not require you to create an account.</p>
<p>Contact Information:</p>
<p>Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your</p>
<p>account or enable certain account features, for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS. If you provide us with your phone</p>
<p>number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us. We may use your contact information to send you information</p>
<p>about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through</p>
<p>third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications</p>
<p>What you share on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services.</p>
<p>ï…¹</p>
<p>Sign in</p>
<p>Language: English </p>
<p>you receive from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the</p>
<p>notification or the instructions on our website. Your Discoverability privacy settings control whether others can find you on Twitter</p>
<p>by your email address or phone number.</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>Additional Information: You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and personalize your</p>
<p>experience across our Services. For example, you may choose to upload and sync your address book so that we can help you find</p>
<p>and connect with users you know or help other users find and connect with you. We may later tailor content, such as making</p>
<p>suggestions or showing user accounts and Tweets for you and other users, based on imported address book contacts. You can</p>
<p>delete your imported address book contacts at any time by visiting your Contacts Dashboard in your privacy settings. If you email</p>
<p>us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on</p>
<p>our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may</p>
<p>send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables</p>
<p>cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our</p>
<p>Services your account on the other service.</p>
<p>Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and other Public Information:</p>
<p>Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and other Public Information: Twitter is primarily designed to help you share</p>
<p>information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through Twitter is information you are asking us to make public.</p>
<p>You may provide us with profile information to make public on Twitter, such as a short biography, your location, your website, date</p>
<p>of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets,</p>
<p>such as when you Tweeted and the client application you used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation time,</p>
<p>language, country, and time zone; and the lists you create, people you follow, and Tweets you Like or Retweet. Twitter broadly and</p>
<p>instantly disseminates your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including search engines,</p>
<p>developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and organizations such as universities, public health</p>
<p>agencies, and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content</p>
<p>like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this</p>
<p>information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information</p>
<p>you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like</p>
<p>protected Tweets, to make the information more private if you want. For certain profile information fields we provide you with</p>
<p>visibility settings to select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us with profile information and you don't see</p>
<p>a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change the language and time zone associated with your account at any</p>
<p>time using your account settings, available at http://twitter.com/settings/account.</p>
<p>Direct M essages and N on-Public Communications:</p>
<p>Direct M essages and N on-Public Communications: We provide certain features that allow you to communicate more</p>
<p>privately. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with other Twitter users. When you privately</p>
<p>communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your</p>
<p>communications, and information related to them. Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with you via</p>
<p>Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public. While features like</p>
<p>Direct Messages are intended to be private, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your</p>
<p>communications.</p>
<p>Location Information:</p>
<p>Location Information: We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location</p>
<p>in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com. We</p>
<p>may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information</p>
<p>about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your</p>
<p>location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for</p>
<p>example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about our use</p>
<p>of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<p>Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services,</p>
<p>and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more</p>
<p>relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p>Links, Tweets, and non-public communications like Direct Messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to</p>
<p>a http://t.co link.</p>
<p>Cookies:</p>
<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve</p>
<p>our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A</p>
<p>cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent</p>
<p>cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing</p>
<p>on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some</p>
<p>browsers' settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your</p>
<p>computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. We honor the Do Not Track browser option to</p>
<p>give you control over how your website visits are used to personalize your Twitter experience and ads. Learn more about our Do</p>
<p>Not Track support here, and about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>Using Our Services:</p>
<p>Using Our Services: We receive information when you interact with our Services, even if you have not created an account ("Log</p>
<p>Data"). For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to</p>
<p>authenticate to a third-party website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service that includes a</p>
<p>Twitter button or widget, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and</p>
<p>application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our</p>
<p>Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through Twitter. We use</p>
<p>Log Data to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p>We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any</p>
<p>common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months,</p>
<p>if not sooner as provided below for Widget Data.</p>
<p>Widget Data:</p>
<p>Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or</p>
<p>widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you</p>
<p>visited and a cookie that identifies your browser ("Widget Data"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting,</p>
<p>de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use</p>
<p>Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in.</p>
<p>Tailored content is stored separately from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. You can control this feature from the</p>
<p>Personalization Setting within your Privacy Settings, available at https://twitter.com/settings/safety.</p>
<p>Commerce Services:</p>
<p>Commerce Services: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration</p>
<p>date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, "Payment Information"), along with your shipping address, to complete a</p>
<p>commerce transaction through our Services. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information (excluding CVV</p>
<p>code) and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your</p>
<p>Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. To facilitate order fulfillment, we</p>
<p>collect and store information created by your purchases made through our Services ("Transaction Data"). Transaction Data may</p>
<p>include the merchant's name and the date, time, and amount of the transaction.</p>
<p>Advertising:</p>
<p>Advertising: Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help</p>
<p>make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on</p>
<p>and off of Twitter. For example, when you interact with content in the Twitter for Android app, we may show content (including</p>
<p>ads) about those same topics when you use Twitter on the web. We do not use the content you share privately in Direct Messages</p>
<p>to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider sensitive,</p>
<p>such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. If you prefer, you can uncheck the Promoted Content setting within your Privacy</p>
<p>Settings so that your account will not be matched to information collected by ad partners, or by us directly on those partners'</p>
<p>websites or apps, to tailor ads to you. Learn more about your privacy options for tailored ads here and about how ads work on our</p>
<p>Services here.</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates: We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Twitter users, partners</p>
<p>(including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or disclose information about you, such as</p>
<p>when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo. Our</p>
<p>ad partners and affiliates may share information with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a</p>
<p>common account identifier (such as an email address), as well as demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions</p>
<p>taken on a website or app. Our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from</p>
<p>their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction:</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-</p>
<p>party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. When you use</p>
<p>Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party application, you are directing us to share your contact information, such as</p>
<p>your phone number, with that application. If you've shared information, like Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user</p>
<p>who accesses Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Service Providers:</p>
<p>Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland,</p>
<p>and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various</p>
<p>blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your</p>
<p>private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other</p>
<p>appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only</p>
<p>on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process</p>
<p>payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or</p>
<p>refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.</p>
<p>Commerce Transactions:</p>
<p>Commerce Transactions: If you make a payment as part of a commerce transaction through our Services, we may provide the</p>
<p>seller, commerce provider, marketplace, or charity with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and</p>
<p>Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order fulfillment, and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping</p>
<p>disputes) and to help prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties'</p>
<p>privacy policies for information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p>Law and Harm:</p>
<p>Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if</p>
<p>we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the</p>
<p>safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users' rights or property. However,</p>
<p>nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a</p>
<p>government's, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or</p>
<p>sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your</p>
<p>information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help</p>
<p>provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates' services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p>Public or N on-Personal Information:</p>
<p>Public or N on-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your public, aggregated or otherwise non-personal</p>
<p>information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, the number of</p>
<p>times people engaged with a Tweet (for example, the number of users who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a</p>
<p>Tweet, even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed</p>
<p>any private personal information (such as your name or contact information). Remember: your privacy and visibility settings</p>
<p>control whether your Tweets and certain profile information are made public. Other information, like your name and username, is</p>
<p>always public on Twitter, unless you delete your account, as described below.</p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the</p>

<p>For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.</p>
<p>Absent a separate arrangement between you and us to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of</p>
<p>deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p>

<p>otherwise engage with (such as by commenting or hearting) on Twitter. Twitter broadly and instantly disseminates your public</p>
<p>information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate</p>
<p>Twitter content into their services, and organizations such as universities, public health agencies, and market research firms that</p>
<p>analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the</p>
<p>Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what</p>
<p>topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for</p>
<p>as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like protected Tweets, to make the information more</p>
<p>private if you want. For certain profile information fields we provide you with visibility settings to select who can see this</p>
<p>information in your profile. If you provide us with profile information and you don't see a visibility setting, that information is</p>
<p>public. You can change the language and time zone associated with your account at any time using your account settings,</p>
<p>available at https://twitter.com/settings/account.</p>
<p>Direct M essages and N on-Public Communications:</p>
<p>Direct M essages and N on-Public Communications: We provide certain features that allow you to communicate more</p>
<p>privately. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with other Twitter users. When you privately</p>
<p>communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your</p>
<p>communications, and information related to them. Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with you via</p>
<p>Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public. When you use features</p>
<p>like Direct Messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your</p>
<p>communications.</p>
<p>Location Information:</p>
<p>Location Information: We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location</p>
<p>in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com. We</p>
<p>may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information</p>
<p>about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your</p>
<p>location to provide features of our Services, such as allowing you to Tweet with your location, and to improve and customize the</p>
<p>Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more</p>
<p>about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<p>Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services,</p>
<p>and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more</p>
<p>relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p>Links, Tweets, and non-public communications like Direct Messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to</p>
<p>a http://t.co link.</p>
<p>Cookies:</p>
<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve</p>
<p>our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A</p>
<p>cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent</p>
<p>cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing</p>
<p>on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some</p>
<p>browsers' settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your</p>
<p>computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. You can control how we personalize your</p>
<p>Twitter experience and ads by using your Personalization and Data settings, which are available at</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/personalization whether or not you have a Twitter account. We respond to these settings rather than the Do</p>
<p>Not Track browser option, which we no longer support. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>Using Our Services:</p>
<p>Using Our Services: We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have</p>
<p>not created an account ("Log Data"). For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email</p>
<p>notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website,</p>
<p>application, or service that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP</p>
<p>address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information</p>
<p>(including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or</p>
<p>interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another</p>
<p>application through Twitter. We use Log Data to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the</p>
<p>content we show you, including ads. You can learn about the interests we have inferred about you from your activity on and off of</p>
<p>Twitter in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes</p>
<p>described in this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username,</p>
<p>full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Twitter for Web Data:</p>
<p>Twitter for Web Data: We may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate</p>
<p>Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons. When you view our content on these websites, we may receive Log</p>
<p>Data that includes the web page you visited. We never associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone</p>
<p>number, or Twitter handle, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other</p>
<p>information that we derive from this data to improve our Services and personalize content for you, such as suggestions for people</p>
<p>to follow, advertising, and other content you may be interested in. You can see and control interests that we use to personalize</p>
<p>your experience in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your_twitter_data. You can also control whether we keep</p>
<p>track of your visits to websites with Twitter content by using your Personalization and Data settings, available at</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p>Advertising:</p>
<p>Advertising: Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help</p>
<p>make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on</p>
<p>and off of Twitter. We do not use the content you share privately in Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also</p>
<p>prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or</p>
<p>health. Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also</p>
<p>referred to as "interest-based advertising"). If you prefer, you can opt out of interest-based advertising by unchecking Personalize</p>
<p>Ads in your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization or through the DAA's consumer</p>
<p>choice tool at https://optout.aboutads.info. We will not use information from the browser (and for logged in users, the account) on</p>
<p>which you opt out for interest-based advertising, and that browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based ads</p>
<p>from Twitter. Learn more about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our Services here.</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates: We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Twitter users, partners</p>
<p>(including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or disclose information about you, such as</p>
<p>when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo. Our</p>
<p>ad partners and affiliates may share information with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an</p>
<p>email address, as well as demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners,</p>
<p>particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our</p>
<p>advertising technology.</p>
<p>Personalizing Across Y our Devices:</p>
<p>Personalizing Across Y our Devices: When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will associate that browser</p>
<p>or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization. Depending on your settings, we may also</p>
<p>personalize your experience on, and based on information from, other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into</p>
<p>Twitter. For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for</p>
<p>Android. You can control whether we link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log into Twitter (or if</p>
<p>you're logged out, whether we link the browser or device you're currently using to any other devices) through your Personalization</p>
<p>and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction:</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-</p>
<p>party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. When you use</p>
<p>Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party application, you are directing us to share your contact information, such as</p>
<p>your phone number, with that application. If you've shared information, like Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user</p>
<p>who accesses Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Service Providers:</p>
<p>Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland,</p>
<p>and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various</p>
<p>blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your</p>
<p>private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other</p>
<p>appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only</p>
<p>on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your credit or debit card number,</p>
<p>card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and</p>
<p>investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes</p>
<p>associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.</p>
<p>Law and Harm:</p>
<p>Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if</p>
<p>we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the</p>
<p>safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users' rights or property. However,</p>
<p>nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a</p>
<p>government's, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or</p>
<p>sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your</p>
<p>information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help</p>
<p>provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates' services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p>Public Information:</p>
<p>Public Information: We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile information, public</p>
<p>Tweets, or the people you follow or that follow you. Remember: your privacy and visibility settings control whether your Tweets</p>
<p>and certain profile information are made public. Other information, like your name and username, is always public on Twitter,</p>
<p>unless you delete your account, as described below.</p>
<p>N on-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:</p>
<p>N on-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information: We may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-</p>
<p>level information such as the total number of times people engaged with a Tweet, the number of users who clicked on a particular</p>
<p>link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an</p>
<p>ad, the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, or aggregated or device-level reports to advertisers about</p>
<p>users who saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter</p>
<p>handle. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through partnerships with entities that</p>
<p>may use data in their possession (including data you may have given them) to link your name, email address, or other personal</p>
<p>information to the information we provide them. These partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so. You can</p>
<p>control whether Twitter shares your information under these partnerships by using your Personalization and Data settings,</p>
<p>available at https://twitter.com/personalization.</p>
<p>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the</p>
<p>personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information,</p>
<p>including your Tweets, by following the instructions here. You can learn more about the interests we have inferred about you in</p>
<p>Your Twitter Data and request access to additional information here.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and</p>
<p>then deleted. When deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com.</p>
<p>For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.</p>
<p>Absent a separate arrangement between you and us to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of</p>
<p>deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile</p>
<p>information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account.</p>
<p>Learn more here.</p>
