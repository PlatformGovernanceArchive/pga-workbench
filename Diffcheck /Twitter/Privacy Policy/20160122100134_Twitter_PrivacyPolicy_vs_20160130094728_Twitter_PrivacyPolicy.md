Twitter Privacy Policy


Our Services instantly connect people everywhere to what<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s most meaningful to them. Any registered user of the Twitter Services


can send a Tweet, which is a message of 140 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like photos,


videos, and links to other websites.

Information Collection and Use


Basic Account Information


Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your


name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On the Twitter Services, your name and username are listed publicly,


including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Twitter Services,


such as searching and viewing public user profiles, do not require registration.


Contact Information


Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your


account or enable Services, for example, for login verification, Twitter via SMS, or Digits by Twitter. If you provide Twitter with your


phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from Twitter. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or


login to a third-party application, you are directing Twitter to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that


application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent


spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may


use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Twitter Services. You may also


unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website.


<span style="background-color: green;">Tip

Additional Information


Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Twitter Services, such as a short

customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are immediately delivered via SMS


and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter


content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends


and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about


what you are making public.


Location Information


Location Information: Twitter may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your


location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on


Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS,


information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information


about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the


Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more


about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.


Links


Links: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party


services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide


more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked


on.<span style="background-color: green;"> Links, Tweets, and direct messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to a http://t.co link. You can


learn more about the benefits of link shortening here.</span>


Cookies


Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve


our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A


cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Twitter may use both session cookies and


persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web


traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. <span style="background-color: green;">Al</span><span style="background-color: red;">Mos</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">hough</span> <span style="background-color: red;">In</span><span style="background-color: green;">mos</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ernet</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">rowsers</span> <span style="background-color: green;">br</span><span style="background-color: red;">aut</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ws</span><span style="background-color: red;">matically acc</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">pt</span><span style="background-color: green;">rs</span> <span style="background-color: green;">automatically accept

earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers,


such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.


Widget Data


Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or


widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you


visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (<span style="background-color: red;">“</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span>Widget Data


Widget Data<span style="background-color: red;">”</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span>). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting,


de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use


Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in.


Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit


information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other


information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.

Third-Parties and Affiliates: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our


various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-


party service providers may collect information sent by your <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">brows</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">vice</span> as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP


address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or


cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this


allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services. If you prefer, you can turn off


tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account will not be matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring


ads. Learn more about your privacy options <span style="background-color: green;">for tailored ads </span>here and about how ads work on our Services here. We may also<span style="background-color: red;"> receive information</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">receive information </span>about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our<span style="background-color: red;"> affiliates’ services,</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">affiliates' services, </span>including the delivery of ads.
