**Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and <span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">O</span>ther Public Information:** Twitter is primarily designed to help you


share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through Twitter is information you are


asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile information <span style="background-color: red;">to</span><span style="background-color: green;">such</span> <span style="background-color: red;">m</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">s a short biography, your


location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages


you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client application you


used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and


the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you Li</span>ke <span style="background-color: red;">publ</span><span style="background-color: green;">or Retweet, and Per</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>c<span style="background-color: green;">ope broadcasts you click or

insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should


think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what


topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the


Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features,


like protected</span> Tweet<span style="background-color: red;">ed and the

**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications:** We provide certain features that allow you to


communicate more privately. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with


other Twitter users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending


and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>them. Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for


instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public. Wh<span style="background-color: red;">il</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">n</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you use

</span>the contents of your communications.


**Location Information:** We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set


your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device,


such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your


mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features


of our Services, such as <span style="background-color: green;">allowing you to </span>Tweet<span style="background-color: red;">ing</span> with your location, and to improve and customize the Services,<span style="background-color: red;"> for</span>

**Links:** We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email


notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do


this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate


click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, Tweets, and non-public


communications like Direct Messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to


a http://t.co link.

Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help


recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. We do not use the content you share privately in


Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads


based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Twitter adheres

users, partners (including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or


disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo.

demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners,


particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by


integrating our advertising technology.


**Personalizing Across Your Devices:** When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will


associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization.


Depending on your settings, we may also personalize your experience on, and based on information from,


other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into Twitter. For example, if you visit websites with


sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android. You can control


whether we link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log into Twitter (or if


you’re logged out, whether we link the browser or device you’re currently using to any other devices) through


your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.


**User Consent or Direction:** We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you


authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your


feedback with a business. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party application,


you are directing us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. If


you’ve shared information, like Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses


Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party


service.


**Service Providers:** We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the


United States, Ireland, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help


provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the


use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such


service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate


confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal


data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your

**Commerce Transactions:** If you make a payment as part of a commerce transaction through our Services,


we may provide the seller, commerce provider, marketplace, or charity with your name, email address,


shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order


fulfillment, and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent, detect, and


investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties’ privacy policies for


information about their privacy practices.


**Law and Harm:** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose


your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process,

<span style="background-color: red;">disclose your information.


**Business Transfers and Affiliates:** In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,


reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This


Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information


about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our


affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.


**Public or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose your public, aggregated or otherwise non-


personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that


follow you, the number of times people engaged with a Tweet (for example, the number of users who clicked


on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet, even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique


users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your


name or contact information). Remember: your privacy and visibility settings control whether your Tweets and


certain profile information are made public. Other information, like your name and username, is always public


on Twitter, unless you delete your account, as described below.


If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct,


delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can


download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here and request


access to additional </span>information here.


You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be


deactivated and then deleted. When deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public


profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your


account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us


to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our


systems, which can take up to a week.


Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like


your user profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter


Services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.<span style="background-color: green;">

This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites,


SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and our other covered services that link


to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you


send us information when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application such as Twitter


for Mac, Twitter for Android, or TweetDeck. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection,


transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes


any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.


When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. If you live


in the United States, your information is controlled by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San


Francisco,</span> C<span style="background-color: red;">A 94103 U.S.A. If y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u live outside the U</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ite</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> States, the data controller respons</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ble for your

posting of your Tweets and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of


Service and Twitter Rules.


Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the


United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and


data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those


in the country where you live. Learn more about our global operations and data transfer here.


If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please submit a request through our form,


available at https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy.


**Basic Account Information:** If you choose to create a Twitter account, you must provide us with some


personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On Twitter,


your name and username are always listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and


you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can create and manage multiple Twitter accounts. If


you use Digits by Twitter, the contact information you provide to log in is not public. Some of our product


features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter user profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s


website, do not require you to create an account.


**Contact Information:** You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number,


to customize your account or enable certain account features, for example, for login verification or Twitter via


SMS. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us.


Twitter Privacy Policy


What you share on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!


Information Collection and Use


We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services.



We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help


prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and


client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you


receive from Twitter. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained


within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your Discoverability privacy settings control whether


others can find you on Twitter by your email address or phone number.


**Additional Information:** You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and


personalize your experience across our Services. For example, you may choose to upload and sync your


address book so that we can help you find and connect with users you know or help other users find and


connect with you. We may later personalize content, such as making suggestions or showing user accounts


and Tweets for you and other users, based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your


imported address book contacts at any time by visiting your Contacts Dashboard


at https://twitter.com/settings/contacts\_dashboard. If you email us, we may keep your message, email


address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to


your account on another service, the other service may send us information that you authorize for use in the


Services. This information may enable cross-posting or otherwise help us improve the Services, and is


deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the


other service.


**Tweets, Following, Lists, Profile, and Other Public Information:** Twitter is primarily designed to help you


share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through Twitter is information you are


asking us to make public. You may provide us with profile information such as a short biography, your


location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the messages


you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client application you


used to Tweet; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and


the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you Like or Retweet, and Periscope broadcasts you click or


otherwise engage with (such as by commenting or hearting) on Twitter. Twitter broadly and instantly


disseminates your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services, including search


engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and organizations such


as universities, public health agencies, and market research firms that analyze the information for trends and


insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should


think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what


topics you may be interested in. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the


Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features,


like protected Tweets, to make the information more private if you want. For certain profile information fields


we provide you with visibility settings to select who can see this information in your profile. If you provide us


with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public. You can change


the language and time zone associated with your account at any time using your account settings, available


at https://twitter.com/settings/account.


**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications:** We provide certain features that allow you to


communicate more privately. For example, you can use Direct Messages to have private conversations with


other Twitter users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending


and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to


them. Please note that if you interact with public Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for


instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public. When you use


features like Direct Messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store,


and re-share the contents of your communications.


**Location Information:** We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to


publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set


your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device,


such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your



mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features


of our Services, such as allowing you to Tweet with your location, and to improve and customize the Services,


for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to


follow. Learn more about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.


**Links:** We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email


notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do


this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate


click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, Tweets, and non-public


communications like Direct Messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to


a http://t.co link.


**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage


data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as


searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer


or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you


interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services,


and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies,


some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to


place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable


cookies. You can control how we personalize your Twitter experience and ads by using your Personalization


and Data settings, which are available at https://twitter.com/personalization whether or not you have a Twitter


account. We respond to these settings rather than the Do Not Track browser option, which we no longer


support. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.


**Using Our Services:** We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our


Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our websites,


sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party


website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service that includes Twitter


content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type,


operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information


(including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when


you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as


when you choose to install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to make inferences, like


what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. You can learn


about the interests we have inferred about you from your activity on and off of Twitter in Your Twitter Data,


available at https://twitter.com/your\_twitter\_data. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in


this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your


username, full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner.


**Twitter for Web Data:** We may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites


that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons. When you view our content on


these websites, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We never associate this


web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter handle, and we delete,


obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other information that we


derive from this data to improve our Services and personalize content for you, such as suggestions for people


to follow, advertising, and other content you may be interested in. You can see and control interests that we


use to personalize your experience in Your Twitter Data, available at https://twitter.com/your\_twitter\_data. You


can also control whether we keep track of your visits to websites with Twitter content by using your


Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.


**Advertising:** Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this


Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help


recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. We do not use the content you share privately in



Direct Messages to serve you ads. Our Twitter Ads Policy also prohibits advertisers from targeting ads


based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Twitter adheres


to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred


to as “interest-based advertising”). If you prefer, you can opt out of interest-based advertising by unchecking


Personalize Ads in your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization or


through the DAA’s consumer choice tool at https://optout.aboutads.info. We will not use information from the


browser (and for logged in users, the account) on which you opt out for interest-based advertising, and that


browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based ads from Twitter. Learn more about your


privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our Services here.


**Third-Parties and Affiliates:** We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other Twitter


users, partners (including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or


disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo.


Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo. Our ad partners and affiliates may share information


with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as


demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners,


particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by


integrating our advertising technology.


**Personalizing Across Your Devices:** When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will


associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization.


Depending on your settings, we may also personalize your experience on, and based on information from,


other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into Twitter. For example, if you visit websites with


sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android. You can control


whether we link your account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log into Twitter (or if


you’re logged out, whether we link the browser or device you’re currently using to any other devices) through


your Personalization and Data settings, available at https://twitter.com/personalization.


**User Consent or Direction:** We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you


authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your


feedback with a business. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or log in to a third-party application,


you are directing us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. If


you’ve shared information, like Direct Messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses


Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party


service.


**Service Providers:** We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the


United States, Ireland, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help


provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the


use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such


service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate


confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal


data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your


credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment services


providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate


dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of


credit or debit cards.


Information Sharing and Disclosure


We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances


described here.



**Law and Harm:** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose


your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process,


or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or


to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any


legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to


disclose your information.


**Business Transfers and Affiliates:** In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,


reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This


Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information


about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our


affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.


**Public Information:** We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile


information, public Tweets, or the people you follow or that follow you. Remember: your privacy and visibility


settings control whether your Tweets and certain profile information are made public. Other information, like


your name and username, is always public on Twitter, unless you delete your account, as described below.


**Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:** We may share or disclose non-personal,


aggregated, or device-level information such as the total number of times people engaged with a Tweet, the


number of users who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the


characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that people are


Tweeting about in a particular location, or aggregated or device-level reports to advertisers about users who


saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, phone number, or


Twitter handle. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through


partnerships with entities that may use data in their possession (including data you may have given them) to


link your name, email address, or other personal information to the information we provide them. These


partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so. You can control whether Twitter shares your


information under these partnerships by using your Personalization and Data settings, available


at https://twitter.com/personalization.


If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct,


delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can


download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here. You can learn


more about the interests we have inferred about you in Your Twitter Data and request access to additional


information here.


You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be


deactivated and then deleted. When deactivated, your account, including your name, username, and public


profile, is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your


account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us


to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our


systems, which can take up to a week.


Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like


your user profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter


Services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.
