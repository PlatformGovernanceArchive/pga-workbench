Information Collection and Use


Tip


 We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.


**Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a Twitter account, you provide some personal information, such as<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">your </span>name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Services,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>require registration.


**Additional Information:** You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>You may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that<span style="background-color: red;"> we can help you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">we can help you </span>find Twitter users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>you. You may unsubscribe<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>If you email us, we may keep your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information described in this section is entirely<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>optional.


**Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:** Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Most of the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and<span style="background-color: red;"> the metadata provided</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">the metadata provided </span>with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>favorites or Retweet and many other<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>bits of information. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>give you settings to make the information more<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your public Tweets are searchable by many search engines<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services. You should be careful about all information that will be made<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>public by Twitter, not just your Tweets.


Tip


 What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.


**Location Information:** You may choose to note your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. If you turn on Tweeting with your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>location, we may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>also save exact coordinates to help improve our service. You can control your location information settings in your account<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>settings.


**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such<span style="background-color: red;"> as your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">as your </span>IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>advertisements, may also be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>included in Log Data.


**Links:** Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links in Tweets across our Services including third party clients by redirecting clicks or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>through<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as<span style="background-color: red;"> how many times a</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">how many times a </span>particular link was clicked on.


**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>require<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is<span style="background-color: red;"> transferred to your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">transferred to your </span>computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>with our Services, to monitor<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>browsers automatically accept cookies.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.


**Third Party Services:** Twitter uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>and wikis,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>browser as part of a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.
