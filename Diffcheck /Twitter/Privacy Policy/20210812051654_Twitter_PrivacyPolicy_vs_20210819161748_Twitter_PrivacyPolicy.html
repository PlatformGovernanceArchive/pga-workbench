<p><strong>You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope</strong></p>
<p><strong>you take away from it:<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></p>
<p><strong>We have made some updates to our Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy. The updated Privacy Policy will go into</strong></p>
<p><strong>effect on August 19, 2021. You can find a copy</strong></p>
<p><strong>of the updated Privacy Policy at the top of this</strong></p>
<p><strong>page followed by the current Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>below.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and</strong></p>
<p><strong>how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the</strong></p>
<p><strong>information that you share with us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information You Share With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>We require certain information to provide our services to you. For</strong></p>
<p><strong>example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content</strong></p>
<p><strong>on Twitter. When you choose to share the information below with us,</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect and use it to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles</p>
<p>or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some</p>
<p>personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter</p>
<p>Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display</p>
<p>name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. If you choose to create a</p>
<p>professional account, you must also provide us with your professional category, and may provide us with additional</p>
<p>information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. You</p>
<p>can also </p>
<p>, for example to express different parts of your identity.</p>
<p>1<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>create and manage multiple Twitter accounts</span></p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Information</strong></p>
<p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your </p>
<p>, your display language, when you created your account,</p>
<p>and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter you</p>
<p>Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. When you share audio or</p>
<p>visual content on our service we may analyze that data to operate our services, for example by providing audio transcription.</p>
<p>The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. If you like,</p>
<p>Retweet, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about</p>
<p>you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach.</p>
<p>Broadcasts (including Twitter Spaces) you create are public along with when you created them. Your engagement with</p>
<p>broadcasts, including viewing, listening, commenting, speaking, reacting to, or otherwise participating in them, either on</p>
<p>Periscope (subject to your settings) or on Twitter, is public along with when you took those actions. On Periscope, so are your</p>
<p>hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a</p>
<p>broadcast live or on replay. Any engagement with another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long</p>
<p>as it remains on our services. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. For</p>
<p>example, other people may </p>
<p>(if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully</p>
<p>about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as</p>
<p>by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and</p>
<p>Twitter for Android.</p>
<p>By publicly posting content, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our</p>
<p>APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global dissemination</p>
<p>of Tweets to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make</p>
<p>that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or</p>
<p>analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge</p>
<p>licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance</p>
<p>program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may</p>

<p>world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">2</p>
<p>3</p>
<p></span><strong>1.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact Information and Address Books</strong></p>
<p>We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and</p>
<p>our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. Subject to your settings, we also use contact information to</p>
<p>enable certain account features (for example, for login verification), to send you information about our services, and to</p>
<p>personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from</p>
<p>Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your</p>
<p>country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and</p>
<p>client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from</p>
<p>Twitter. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>
<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you</p>
<p>know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>profile information</p>
<p>tag you in a photo</p>
<p></span>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your</p>
<p>Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,</p>
<p>friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.</p>
<p>You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>
<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to</p>
<p>your request.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications</strong></p>
<p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can</p>
<p>use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on</p>
<p>Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your</p>
<p>communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to</p>
<p>http://t.co URLs, </p>
<p>, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use information about</p>
<p>whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of</p>
<p>our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of</p>
<p>your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a</p>
<p>way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,</p>
<p>those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that </p>
<p>of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -</p>
<p>which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>

<p>detection of spam</p>
<p>recipients have</p>
<p>their own copy</p>
<p></span>You may provide us with </p>
<p>, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,</p>
<p>and billing address, in order to purchase advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services. If you make a payment</p>
<p>or send money using Twitter features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your</p>
<p>transaction such as when it was made or when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>6</p>
<p><strong>1.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>How You Control the Information You Share with Us</strong></p>
<p>Your Privacy and safety settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether your Tweets are publicly available on Twitter</p>
<p>Whether others can tag you in a photo</p>
<p>Whether you will be able to receive Direct Messages from anyone on Twitter or just your followers</p>
<p>Whether others can find you based on your email or phone number</p>
<p>Whether you upload your address book to Twitter for storage and use</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information We Receive About You</strong></p>
<p><strong>We receive certain information when you use our services or other</strong></p>
<p><strong>websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from</strong></p>
<p><strong>third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with</strong></p>
<p><strong>us, we use the data below to operate our services.</strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>payment information</span></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
<p>We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device</p>
<p>settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current</p>
<p>precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more</p>
<p>relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location</p>
<p>here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope</p>
<p>broadcasts here.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>2.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails</p>
<p>we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.</p>
<p>If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from</p>
<p>Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it</p>
<p>was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and</p>
<p>similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many</p>
<p>parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept</p>
<p>cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to </p>
<p>. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or</p>
<p>device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services,</p>
<p>to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account</p>
<p>security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not</p>
<p>support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”</p>
<p>even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our</p>
<p>email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>place a cookie on</p>
<p>your computer</p>
<p></span>content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and</p>
<p>application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data</p>
<p>when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.</p>
<p>We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log</p>
<p>Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to</p>
<p>improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.</p>
<p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences</p>
<p>like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and</p>
<p>design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter for Web Data</strong></p>
<p>When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet</p>
<p>buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the</p>
<p>use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We</p>
<p>do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,</p>
<p>obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>place a cookie on</p>
<p>your computer</span></p>
<p>located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or EFTA States.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>2.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers and Other Ad Partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to</p>
<p>help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you</p>
<p>ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device</p>
<p>IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of</p>
<p>our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by</p>
<p>integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the</p>
<p>websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that</p>
<p>Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred</p>
<p>to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based</p>
<p>advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on</p>
<p>categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more</p>
<p>about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising</p>
<p>services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>2.7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your</p>
<p>data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>2.8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Third Parties and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners</p>
<p>who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to</p>
<p>your Twitter account.</p>
<p>You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us</p>
<p>information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting</p>
<p>or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke</p>
<p>this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have</p>
<p>connected to Twitter.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>2.9</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity</strong></p>
<p>When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes</p>
<p>such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with</p>
<p>browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other</p>
<p>browsers or devices). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that</p>
<p>information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other</p>
<p>information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common</p>
<p>components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For</p>
<p>example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for</p>
<p>Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared</p>
<p>first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email</p>
<p>addresses containing those components.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>2.10</strong></p>
<p><strong>How You Control Additional Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p>Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter</p>
<p>How we personalize based on your inferred identity</p>
<p>Whether we collect and use your precise location</p>
<p>Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been</p>
<p>Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content</p>
<p>You can use Your Twitter data to review:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads</p>
<p>Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners</p>
<p>Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests</p>
<p>We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.</p>
<p>This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account</p>
<p>that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch</p>
<p>history through your settings.</p>
<p>Please see here for more details of how we collect and use your data.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Share and Disclose</strong></p>
<p><strong>As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly</strong></p>
<p><strong>disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the</strong></p>
<p><strong>limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we</strong></p>
<p><strong>do so subject to your control, because it’s important for operating our</strong></p>
<p><strong>services, or because it’s required by law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing You Control</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web</p>
<p>client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on Twitter. When you watch or</p>
<p>otherwise interact with content from these partners, they may receive and process your personal data as described in their</p>
<p>privacy policies. If you do not want this content to play automatically, you can adjust your autoplay settings. If you’ve shared</p>
<p>information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,</p>
<p>keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. You</p>
<p>can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in</p>
<p>this way by using the “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” option in your Personalization and Data</p>
<p>settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our</p>
<p>service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in our Help Center.)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services for us in the United States, Ireland, and other</p>
<p>countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs</p>
<p>and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal</p>
<p>data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate</p>
<p>confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our</p>
<p>behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). We share</p>
<p>your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or</p>
<p>other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with</p>
<p>the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>3.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve,</p>
<p>use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a</p>
<p>law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of</p>
<p>our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to </p>
<p>; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or</p>
<p>the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal</p>
<p>defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and Change of Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may</p>
<p>be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our</p>
<p>affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>explain why we have removed</p>
<p>content or accounts from our services</p>
<p></span><strong>3.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a</p>
<p>Tweet, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one</p>
<p>did), the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about</p>
<p>how many people saw or clicked on their ads.</p>

<p></span><strong>Managing Your Personal Information With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>You control the personal data you share with us. You can access or</strong></p>
<p><strong>rectify this data at any time. You can also deactivate your account. We</strong></p>
<p><strong>also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where</strong></p>
<p><strong>applicable for the use of data you have provided to Twitter. And we</strong></p>
<p><strong>make the data you shared through our services portable and provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>easy ways for you to contact us. Please note, to help protect your</strong></p>
<p><strong>privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity</strong></p>
<p><strong>before granting you access to your personal information or complying</strong></p>
<p><strong>with deletion, portability, or other related requests.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accessing or Rectifying Your Personal Data</strong></p>

<p>information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here. On Periscope, you can request correction, deletion, or</p>
<p>modification of your personal data, and download your account information, by following the instructions here. You can learn</p>

<p>longer be viewable on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still</p>
<p>possible to restore your Twitter account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your profile</p>
<p>information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.</p>

<p></span></p>
<p><strong>1</strong> <strong>The many sides of you.</strong> Let your imagination run free. Explore your interests with a number of different identities.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Hello, World.</strong> Your profile information is displayed under your photo and username on your profile page.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> <strong>Keep a low profile.</strong> Friends want to tag you in a photo? Lucky you. If you're not into that sort of thing, you can always change your settings.</p>
<p><strong>4 Spam stinks.</strong> We scan your Direct Messages to try and prevent spam for you and our service. </p>
<p><strong>5 Just like email.</strong> Only send Direct Messages to people you trust. Remember, even though someone can’t Retweet your Direct Messages, they still have a</p>
<p>copy of your message. </p>
<p><strong>6 Approved by you.</strong> We use your payment information to process transactions you’ve approved and for fraud detection.</p>
<p><strong>7 Not hungry?</strong> You can change your cookie settings in your web browser. </p>
<p><strong>8 Transparency matters.</strong> We remove content from our services when it violates our rules, like if it glorifies violence. When that content is gone, we want</p>
<p>you to know. </p>
<p><strong>9 You’re in control.</strong> Even as Twitter evolves, you can always change your privacy settings. The power is yours to choose what you share in the world.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">you</p>
<p>agree</p>
<p><strong>You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope</strong></p>
<p><strong>you take away from it:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have made some updates to our Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy. The updated Privacy Policy will go into</strong></p>
<p><strong>effect on August 19, 2021. The current Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy is below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Effective until August 19, 2021)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information You Share With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>We require certain information to provide our services to you. For example,</strong></p>
<p><strong>you must have an account in order to upload or share content on Twitter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and</strong></p>
<p><strong>use it to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basic Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles</p>
<p>or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some</p>
<p>personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter</p>
<p>Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display</p>
<p>name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also </p>
<p>, for example to express different parts of your identity.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Information</strong></p>
<p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your </p>
<p>, your time zone and language, when you created your</p>
<p>account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter</p>
<p>you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create,</p>
<p>people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. If you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise</p>
<p>publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad</p>
<p>with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Periscope broadcasts you create,</p>
<p>click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So</p>
<p>are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you</p>
<p>watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast</p>
<p>will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who</p>
<p>use our services may also be public. For example, other people may </p>
<p>(if your settings allow) or mention you</p>
<p>in a Tweet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully</p>
<p>about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as</p>
<p>by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and</p>
<p>Twitter for Android.</p>
<p>By publicly posting content when you Tweet, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including</p>
<p>through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global</p>
<p>dissemination of Tweets to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and</p>
<p>embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a</p>
<p>news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free</p>
<p>and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a</p>
<p>compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their</p>
<p>offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we make public data on Twitter</p>
<p>available to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><strong>1.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact Information and Address Books</strong></p>
<p>We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and</p>
<p>our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to enable certain account</p>
<p>features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our services, and to</p>
<p>personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from</p>
<p>Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your</p>
<p>country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and</p>
<p>client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from</p>
<p>Twitter. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>
<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you</p>
<p>create and</p>
<p>manage multiple Twitter accounts</p>
<p>profile information</p>
<p>tag you in a photo</p>
<p>know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your</p>
<p>Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,</p>
<p>friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.</p>
<p>You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>
<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to</p>
<p>your request.</p>
<p><strong>1.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications</strong></p>
<p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can</p>
<p>use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on</p>
<p>Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your</p>
<p>communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to</p>
<p>http://t.co URLs, </p>
<p>, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use information about</p>
<p>whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of</p>
<p>our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of</p>
<p>your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a</p>
<p>way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,</p>
<p>those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that </p>
<p>of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -</p>
<p>which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><strong>1.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
<p>You may provide us with </p>
<p>, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,</p>
<p>and billing address, in order to purchase advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><strong>1.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>How You Control the Information You Share with Us</strong></p>
<p>Your Privacy and safety settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether your Tweets are publicly available on Twitter</p>
<p>Whether others can tag you in a photo</p>
<p>Whether you will be able to receive Direct Messages from anyone on Twitter or just your followers</p>
<p>Whether others can find you based on your email or phone number</p>
<p>Whether you upload your address book to Twitter for storage and use</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information We Receive About You</strong></p>
<p><strong>We receive certain information when you use our services or other</strong></p>
<p><strong>websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from</strong></p>
<p><strong>third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with</strong></p>
<p><strong>us, we use the data below to operate our services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
<p>We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device</p>
<p>settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current</p>
<p>precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more</p>
<p>relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location</p>
<p>here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope</p>
<p>broadcasts here.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails</p>
<p>we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.</p>
<p>If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from</p>
<p>Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it</p>
<p>was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and</p>
<p>similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many</p>
<p>parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept</p>
<p>cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to </p>
<p>. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or</p>
<p>device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services,</p>
<p>to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account</p>
<p>security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not</p>
<p>support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”</p>
<p>even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our</p>
<p>email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter</p>
<p>content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and</p>
<p>application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data</p>
<p>when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.</p>
<p>We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log</p>
<p>Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to</p>
<p>improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.</p>
<p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences</p>
<p>like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and</p>
<p>design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitter for Web Data</strong></p>
<p>When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet</p>
<p>buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the</p>
<p>use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We</p>
<p>place a cookie on</p>
<p>your computer</p>
<p>do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,</p>
<p>obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be</p>
<p>located in the European Union or EFTA States.</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers and Other Ad Partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to</p>
<p>help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you</p>
<p>ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device</p>
<p>IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of</p>
<p>our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by</p>
<p>integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the</p>
<p>websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that</p>
<p>Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred</p>
<p>to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based</p>
<p>advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on</p>
<p>categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more</p>
<p>about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising</p>
<p>services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>
<p>If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your</p>
<p>data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Third Parties and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners</p>
<p>who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to</p>
<p>your Twitter account.</p>
<p>You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us</p>
<p>information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting</p>
<p>or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke</p>
<p>this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have</p>
<p>connected to Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>2.9</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity</strong></p>
<p>When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes</p>
<p>such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with</p>
<p>browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other</p>
<p>browsers or devices). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that</p>
<p>information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other</p>
<p>information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common</p>
<p>components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For</p>
<p>example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for</p>
<p>Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared</p>
<p>first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email</p>
<p>addresses containing those components.</p>

<p><strong>How You Control Additional Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p>Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:</p>
<p>Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter</p>
<p>How we personalize based on your inferred identity</p>
<p>Whether we collect and use your precise location</p>
<p>Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been</p>
<p>Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content</p>
<p>You can use Your Twitter data to review:</p>
<p>Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads</p>
<p>Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners</p>
<p>Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests</p>
<p>We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.</p>
<p>This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account</p>
<p>that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch</p>
<p>history through your settings.</p>
<p>Please see here for more details of how we collect and use your data.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Share and Disclose</strong></p>
<p><strong>As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly</strong></p>
<p><strong>disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the</strong></p>
<p><strong>limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we</strong></p>
<p><strong>do so subject to your control, because it’s important for operating our</strong></p>
<p><strong>services, or because it’s required by law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing You Control</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web</p>
<p>client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared</p>
<p>information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,</p>
<p>keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. You</p>
<p>can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in</p>
<p>this way by using the “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” option in your Personalization and Data</p>
<p>settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our</p>
<p>service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in our Help Center.) </p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services for us in the United States, Ireland, and other</p>
<p>countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs</p>
<p>and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal</p>
<p>data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate</p>
<p>confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our</p>
<p>behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). We share</p>
<p>your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or</p>
<p>other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with</p>
<p>the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve,</p>
<p>use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a</p>
<p>law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of</p>
<p>our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to </p>
<p>; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or</p>
<p>the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal</p>
<p>defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and Change of Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may</p>
<p>be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our</p>
<p>affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a</p>
<p>Tweet, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one</p>
<p>did), the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about</p>
<p>how many people saw or clicked on their ads.</p>
<p>explain why we have removed</p>
<p>content or accounts from our services</p>
<p><strong>Managing Your Personal Information With Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>You control the personal data you share with us. You can access or</strong></p>
<p><strong>rectify this data at any time. You can also deactivate your account. We</strong></p>
<p><strong>also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where</strong></p>
<p><strong>applicable for the use of data you have provided to Twitter. And we</strong></p>
<p><strong>make the data you shared through our services portable and provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>easy ways for you to contact us. Please note, to help protect your</strong></p>
<p><strong>privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity</strong></p>
<p><strong>before granting you access to your personal information or complying</strong></p>
<p><strong>with deletion, portability, or other related requests.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accessing or Rectifying Your Personal Data</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deletion</strong></p>
<p>We keep Log Data for a maximum of 18 months. If you follow the instructions here (or for Periscope here), your account will</p>

<p>longer be viewable on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still</p>
<p>possible to restore your Twitter account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your profile</p>
<p>information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.</p>

<p><strong>4.3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent</strong></p>

<p>time. It may take a short amount of time for privacy settings to be fully reflected throughout our systems.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> <strong>The many sides of you.</strong> Let your imagination run free. Explore your interests with a number of different identities.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Hello, World.</strong> Your profile information is displayed under your photo and username on your profile page.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> <strong>Keep a low profile.</strong> Friends want to tag you in a photo? Lucky you. If you're not into that sort of thing, you can always change your settings.</p>
<p><strong>4 Spam stinks.</strong> We scan your Direct Messages to try and prevent spam for you and our service. </p>
<p><strong>5 Just like email.</strong> Only send Direct Messages to people you trust. Remember, even though someone can’t Retweet your Direct Messages, they still have a</p>
<p>copy of your message. </p>
<p><strong>6 Approved by you.</strong> We use your payment information to process transactions you’ve approved and for fraud detection.</p>
<p><strong>7 Not hungry?</strong> You can change your cookie settings in your web browser. </p>
<p><strong>8 Transparency matters.</strong> We remove content from our services when it violates our rules, like if it glorifies violence. When that content is gone, we want</p>
<p>you to know. </p>
<p><strong>9 You’re in control.</strong> Even as Twitter evolves, you can always change your privacy settings. The power is yours to choose what you share in the world.
