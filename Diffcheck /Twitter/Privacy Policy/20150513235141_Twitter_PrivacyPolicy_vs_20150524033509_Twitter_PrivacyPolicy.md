Basic Account Information


Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your


name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On the Twitter Services, your name and username are listed publicly,


including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Twitter Services,

login to a third-party application, you are directing Twitter to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that


application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent


spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may


use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Twitter Services. You may also


unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website.


Your privacy settings control whether others can find you on the Twitter Services by your email address or phone number.

biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find


users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address


book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. Learn more here. If you email us, we may keep


your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to


your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your


registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting,


helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your


account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.


Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information


Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information


with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Twitter Services is information you are asking us to make public.


Your public information includes the messages you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the


client application you used to Tweet; the language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create,


people you follow, Tweets you mark as favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the


Twitter Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the


content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Twitter Services


public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like direct messages, to make the


information more private if you want. The Twitter Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide


range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are immediately


delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that


integrate Twitter content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the


information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you


should think carefully about what you are making public.


Location Information


Location Information: Twitter may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your


location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on


Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS,


information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information


about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the


Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more


about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.



Links


Links: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party


services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide


more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked


on.


Cookies


Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve


our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A


cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Twitter may use both session cookies and


persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web


traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.


You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from


the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use


cookies and similar technologies here.


Log Data


Log Data: When you use our Services, we may receive information (“Log Data


Log Data”) such as your IP address, browser type,


operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and


application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example,


when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-


party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. We may also receive Log Data


when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose


to install another application through Twitter. Twitter uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make


inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done


earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers,


such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.


Widget Data


Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or


widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you


visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (“Widget Data


Widget Data”). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting,


de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use


Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in.


Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit


information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other


information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.


Commerce Services


Commerce Services: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration


date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, “Payment Information


Payment Information”), along with your shipping address, to complete a


commerce transaction through our Services. You may also provide your credit or debit card number to register for card-linked


services, such as offers. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping


address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information


and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your


purchases made through our Services (“Transaction Data


Transaction Data”). If you register your credit or debit card with Twitter for card-linked


services, we receive information about the card transactions from a third-party payment services provider or card network


(“Registered Card Data


Registered Card Data”). Transaction Data and Registered Card Data may include the merchant’s name and the date, time and


amount of the transaction. Twitter uses Registered Card Data to verify eligibility for card-linked services, and may also use


Registered Card Data to limit the number of offers available to you and keep track of your offers.


Third-Parties and Affiliates


Third-Parties and Affiliates: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our


various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-


party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP


address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or


cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this


allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services. If you prefer, you can turn off



tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account will not be matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring


ads. Learn more about your privacy options here and about how ads work on our Services here. We may also receive information


about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services,


including the delivery of ads.


Information Sharing and Disclosure


Tip


Tip : We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.


User Consent or Direction


User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-


party web client or application to access your account. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they


mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo on the Twitter


Services. If you’ve shared information, like direct messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses the Twitter


Services through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.


Service Providers


Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland,


and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent


with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third


parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with


payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate


dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.


We may share your credit or debit card number with payment services providers or card networks to monitor card transactions at


participating merchants and track redemption activity for the purposes of providing card-linked services.


Sellers of Goods and Services


Sellers of Goods and Services: If you buy goods or services through our Services, we may provide the seller, commerce


provider or marketplace with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate


payment processing, order fulfilment and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent,


detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties’ privacy policies for information about


their privacy practices.


Law and Harm


Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we


believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the


safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter’s rights or property. However, nothing in


this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a


government’s, request to disclose your information.


Business Transfers and Affiliates


Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or


sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your


information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help


provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.


N on-Private or N on-Personal Information


N on-Private or N on-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-


personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the


number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or


clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).


Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information


If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the


personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information,


including your Tweets, by following the instructions here and request access to additional information here.



You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and
