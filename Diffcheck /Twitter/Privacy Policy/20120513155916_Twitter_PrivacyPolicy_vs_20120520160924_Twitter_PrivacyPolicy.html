<p>information de</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: red;">cribed in this section is </span>entirely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.</p>
<p>Most of the information you provide <span style="background-color: red;">to </span>us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>the</span> <span style="background-color: green;">the</p>
<p></span>metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as</p>
<p>favorites or Retweet<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> and many other bits of information<span style="background-color: green;"> that result from your use of the Services</span>. Our default is almost always to make the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information you provide public <span style="background-color: green;">for as long as you do not delete it from Twitter, </span>but we generally<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>give</span> <span style="background-color: red;">you settin</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">ive you </span>s<span style="background-color: green;">ettings to make the information more</p>
<p>private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public</p>
<p>Tweets may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services, with</p>
<p>one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives Tweets for historical purposes. When you share information or content</p>
<p>like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location</p>
<p>when you set your trend location on Twitter.com or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set your</p>
<p>Tweet location preferences in your account settings and learn more about this feature here. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences</p>
<p>here. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to</p>
<p>improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client</p>
<p>applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to</p>
<p>be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not</p>
<p>require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is</p>
<p>transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact</p>
<p>with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to</p>
<p>prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information</span> (<span style="background-color: green;">"<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information</p>
<p>such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and</p>
<p>application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our</p>
<p>websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Twitter account to authenticate to a third-party website or</p>
<p>application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. Twitter uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure,</p>
<p>customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or</p>
<p>remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Widget Data:</strong> We may tailor content for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these</p>
<p>websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your</p>
<p>browser ("<strong>Widget Data</strong>"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually</p>
<p>instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. While we have the Widget Data, we may use it to tailor content for you, such as</p>
<p>suggestions for people to follow on Twitter. Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID and is separated from other Widget Data</p>
<p>such as page-visit information. This feature is optional and not yet available to all users. If you want, you can suspend it or turn it off, which</p>
<p>removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other</p>
<p>information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and</p>
<p>wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information</p>
<p>sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.</p>

<p>reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or</p>
<p>technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or</p>
<p>objections that you may have to a third partyâ€™s, including a governmentâ€™s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information</p>

<p>particular link (even if only one did).</p>

<p>When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your</p>
<p>account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which</p>
<p>can take up to a week.</p>

<p>public by Twitter, not just your Tweets.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to note your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. If you turn on Tweeting with your</p>
<p>location, we may also save exact coordinates to help improve our service. You can control your location information settings in your account</p>
<p>settings (http://twitter.com/account/settings).</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such</p>
<p>as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, and search terms. Other</p>
<p>actions, such as interactions with our website, applications and advertisements, may also be included in Log Data. If we havenâ€™t already deleted</p>
<p>the Log Data earlier, we will either delete it or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address,</p>
<p>after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links in Tweets across our Services including third party services and clients by</p>
<p>redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click</p>
