Prov</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ding the additional


information de</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">


</span><span style="background-color: red;">cribed in this section is </span>entirely optional.


**Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:** Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.


Most of the information you provide <span style="background-color: red;">to </span>us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and<span style="background-color: red;">


the</span> <span style="background-color: green;">the


</span>metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as


favorites or Retweet<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> and many other bits of information<span style="background-color: green;"> that result from your use of the Services</span>. Our default is almost always to make the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information you provide public <span style="background-color: green;">for as long as you do not delete it from Twitter, </span>but we generally<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>give you settings <span style="background-color: green;">to make the information more


private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public


Tweets may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services, with


one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives Tweets for historical purposes. When you share information or content


like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.


**Location Information:** You may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location


when you set your trend location on Twitter.com or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set your


Tweet location preferences in your account settings and learn more about this feature here. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences


here. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to


improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.


**Links:** Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client


applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to


be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.


**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not


require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is


transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact


with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.


Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to


prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.


**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information </span>(<span style="background-color: green;">"**Log Data**") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information


such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and



application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our


websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Twitter account to authenticate to a third-party website or


application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. Twitter uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure,


customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or


remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.


**Widget Data:** We may tailor content for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these


websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your


browser ("**Widget Data**"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually


instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. While we have the Widget Data, we may use it to tailor content for you, such as


suggestions for people to follow on Twitter. Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID and is separated from other Widget Data


such as page-visit information. This feature is optional and not yet available to all users. If you want, you can suspend it or turn it off, which


removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other


information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.


**Third-Party Service Providers:** Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and


wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information


sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
