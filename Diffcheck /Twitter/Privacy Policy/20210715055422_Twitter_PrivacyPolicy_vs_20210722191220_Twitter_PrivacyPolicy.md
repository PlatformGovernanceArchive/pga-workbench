**Twitter Privacy Policy**

**We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and**

**how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.**

**We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the**

**information that you share with us.**

**That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.**

 **Privacy Policy**

 

**Information You Share With Us**

**1.1**

**Basic Account Information**

You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles

or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some

personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter

Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display

name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. <span style="background-color: green;">If you choose to create a

professional account, you must also provide us with your professional category, and may provide us with additional

information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. </span>You<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you

watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast

will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who

use our services may also be public. </span>For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>example, other people may 

 (if your settings allow) or mention you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>in a Tweet.

You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully

about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as

by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and

Twitter for Android.

By publicly posting content<span style="background-color: red;"> when you Tweet</span>, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including<span style="background-color: red;">

**Contact Information and Address Books**

We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and

our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. <span style="background-color: green;">Subject to your settings, we also use contact information to

enable certain account features (for example, for login verification), to send you information about our services, and to

personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from

Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your

country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and

client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from

Twitter. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.

You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.

If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to

your request.

**1.4**

**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications**

We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can

use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on

Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your

communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to

http://t.co URLs, 

, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use information about

whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of

our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of

your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a

way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,

those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that 

 of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -

which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails

we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.

If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from

Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it

was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.<span style="background-color: green;">

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and

similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many

parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept

cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to 

. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or

device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services,

to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account

security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not

support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.

when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.

We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log

Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to

improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.

We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences

like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and

design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.<span style="background-color: red;">

**Advertisers and Other Ad Partners**

Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to

help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you

ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device

IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of

our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by

integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the

websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that

Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.

Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred

to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based

advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on

categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more

about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.

If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising

services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy

Policy.

</span>**2.8**

**Other Third Parties and Affiliates**

We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners

who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to

your Twitter account.

You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us

information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting

or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>**Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity**

When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes

such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with

browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other

browsers or devices). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that

information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other

information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common

components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For

example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for

Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared

first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email

addresses containing those components.<span style="background-color: green;">

 </span>

**How You Control Additional Information We Receive**

Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:

Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter

How we personalize based on your inferred identity

Whether we collect and use your precise location

Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been

Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content

You can use Your Twitter data to review:

<span style="background-color: green;">

•

•

</span>Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads

Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners

Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests

We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.

This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account

that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch

history through your settings.

**Information We Share and Disclose**

**As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly**

**disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the**

**limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we**

**do so subject to your control, because it’s important for operating our**

**services, or because it’s required by law.**

**3.1**

**Sharing You Control**

We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web

client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. <span style="background-color: green;">Similarly, to

 

improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on Twitter. When you watch or

otherwise interact with content from these partners, they may receive and process your personal data as described in their

privacy policies. If you do not want this content to play automatically, you can adjust your autoplay settings. </span>If you’ve shared

information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,

keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.

Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. You

can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in

this way by using the “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” option in your Personalization and Data

settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our

service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in our Help Center.)<span style="background-color: red;"> 

 

</span> 

**3.2**

**Service Providers**

We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services for us in the United States, Ireland, and other

countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs

and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal

data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate

confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our

behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). We share

your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or

other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with

the acceptance of credit and debit cards.

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span>**3.3**

**Law, Harm, and the Public Interest**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve,

use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a

law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of

our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to 

; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or

the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal

defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.

**3.4**

**Affiliates and Change of Ownership**

In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may

be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new

entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our

affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.

</span>**3.5**

**Non-Personal Information**

We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a

Tweet, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one

did), the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about

how many people saw or clicked on their ads.

**(Effective until August 19, 2021)**

**Information You Share With Us**

 

**We require certain information to provide our services to you. For example,**

**you must have an account in order to upload or share content on Twitter.**

**When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and**

**use it to operate our services.**

 

**1.1**

**Basic Account Information**

You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles

or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some

 

 

personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter

Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display

name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also 

, for example to express different parts of your identity.

**1.2**

**Public Information**

Most activity on Twitter is public, including your 

, your time zone and language, when you created your

account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter

you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create,

people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. If you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise

publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad

with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Periscope broadcasts you create,

click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So

are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you

watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast

will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who

use our services may also be public. For example, other people may 

 (if your settings allow) or mention you

in a Tweet.

You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully

about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as

by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and

Twitter for Android.

By publicly posting content when you Tweet, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including

through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global

dissemination of Tweets to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and

embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use </span>-<span style="background-color: red;">related</span> <span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">f</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">mplaint, please contact us he</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>e<span style="background-color: green;">xample, displaying Tweets on a

news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free

and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a

compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their

offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we make public data on Twitter

features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via</span> S<span style="background-color: red;">hield, if

you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal

Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your

country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and

client applications. You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from

Twitter. You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.

You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you

Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,

friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.

You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.

If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to

your request.

**1.4**

**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications**

We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can

use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on

Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your

communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to

http://t.co URLs, 

, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use information about

whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of

our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of

your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a

way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,

those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that 

 of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -

which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.

precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more

relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location

here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope

broadcasts here.

 

**2.2**

 

**Links**

In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails

we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.

If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from

Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it

was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.

**2.3**

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and

similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many

parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept

cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to 

. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or

device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services,

to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account

security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not

support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.

**2.4**

**Log Data**

We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”

even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our

email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter

content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,

operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and

application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data

when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.

We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log

Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to

improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.

We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences

like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and

design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.

 

**2.5**

**Twitter for Web Data**

When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet

buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the

use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We

 

 

place a cookie on

your computer

do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,

obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be

located in the European</span> U<span style="background-color: red;">S Federal Trade

Commissio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;"> and other author</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">zed statut</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ry bodies. U</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">der</span> <span style="background-color: red;">certain circumstances, participants may be liable f</span>or<span style="background-color: red;"> the

transfer of personal data from the EU,</span> EFTA States<span style="background-color: red;">, o</span><span style="background-color: green;">.

**2.6**

**Adve</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">tisers and Other Ad Partners**

Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to

help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you

ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device

IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of

our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by

integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the

websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that

Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.

Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred

to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based

advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on

categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more

about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.

If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising

services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy

Policy.

**2.7**

**Developers**

If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your

data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.

 

**2.8**

**Other Third Parties and Affiliates**

We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners

who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to

your Twitter account.

You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us

information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting

or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke

this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have

connected to Twitter.

 

 

**2.9**

**Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity**

When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes

such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with

browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other

browsers or devices). When you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that

information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other

information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common

components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For

example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for

Android and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared

first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email

addresses containing those components.

**2.10**

**How You Control Additional Information We Receive**

Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:

Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter

How we personalize based on your inferred identity

Whether we collect and use your precise location

Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been

Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content

You can use Your Twitter data to review:

Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads

Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners

Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests

We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.

This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account

that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch

history through your settings.

Please see here for more details of how we collect and use your data.

**Information We Share and Disclose**

**As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly**

**disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the**

**limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we**

**do so subject to your control, because it’s important for operating our**

**services, or because it’s required by law.**

**3.1**

**Sharing You Control**

We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web

client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared

information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,

keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.

Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. You

can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in

this way by using the “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” option in your Personalization and Data

settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our

service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in our Help Center.) 

 

 

**3.2**

**Service Providers**

We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services for us in</span> the United <span style="background-color: green;">States, Ireland, and other

countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs

and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal

data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate

confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our

behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). We share

your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or

other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with

the acceptance of credit and debit cards.

**3.3**

**Law, Harm, and the Public Interest**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve,

use, share, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a

law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of

our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to 

; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or

the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal

defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.

**3.4**

**Affiliates and Change of Ownership**

In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may

be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new

entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our

affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.

 

**3.5**

**Non-Personal Information**

We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a

Tweet, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one

did), the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about

how many people saw or clicked on their ads.
