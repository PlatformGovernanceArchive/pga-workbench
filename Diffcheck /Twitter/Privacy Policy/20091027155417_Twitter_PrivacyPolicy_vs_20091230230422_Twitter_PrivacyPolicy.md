by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a compu</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">er or u</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">ing or touching information in any way</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">Fo</span><span style="background-color: red;">inc</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ud</span><span style="background-color: green;">low</span>ing, <span style="background-color: green;">Lists and other Pu</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">ut not </span>li<span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">mited</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">Inf</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">rmation:** Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with


the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the

people you follow, the Tweets you mark as favorites or Retweet and many other bits of information. Our default is almost always to


make the information you provide public but we </span>g<span style="background-color: green;">enerally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your


public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">st</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> publ</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">c Tweets are searchable by many search

all information that will be made public by Twitter</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">not just your Tw</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ts.


Tip Tip: What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.


**Location Information:** You may choose to note your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You can control your


location information in your account set</span>ting<span style="background-color: red;">, u</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">in</span><span style="background-color: green;">.

email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to


include in your public profile.


**Additional Information** Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people in the Twitter


network to enable you to connect with people on Twitter, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide


additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if


you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better


identify yourself and find new friends and opportunities in the Twitter system. If you activate the mobile phone options per the


Terms of Service at www.twitter.com/tos, we will collect your cellular phone number account information. You will receive


notifications on your cellular phone account in a number of cases, such as when a Twitter member adds you as a friend or sends


you a message. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and


correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to


you.


**Use of Contact Information** In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information


about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to


receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the


communications.
