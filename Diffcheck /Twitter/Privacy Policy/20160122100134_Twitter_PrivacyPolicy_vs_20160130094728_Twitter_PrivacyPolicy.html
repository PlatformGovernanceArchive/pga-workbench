<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Basic Account Information</p>
<p>Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your</p>
<p>name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On the Twitter Services, your name and username are listed publicly,</p>
<p>including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Twitter Services,</p>
<p>such as searching and viewing public user profiles, do not require registration.</p>
<p>Contact Information</p>
<p>Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your</p>
<p>account or enable Services, for example, for login verification, Twitter via SMS, or Digits by Twitter. If you provide Twitter with your</p>
<p>phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from Twitter. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or</p>
<p>login to a third-party application, you are directing Twitter to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that</p>
<p>application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent</p>
<p>spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may</p>
<p>use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Twitter Services. You may also</p>
<p>unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website.</p>

<p>customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are immediately delivered via SMS</p>
<p>and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter</p>
<p>content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends</p>
<p>and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about</p>
<p>what you are making public.</p>
<p>Location Information</p>
<p>Location Information: Twitter may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your</p>
<p>location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on</p>
<p>Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS,</p>
<p>information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information</p>
<p>about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the</p>
<p>Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more</p>
<p>about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>Links: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party</p>
<p>services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide</p>
<p>more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked</p>
<p>on.<span style="background-color: green;"> Links, Tweets, and direct messages shared on the Services will be processed and links shortened to a http://t.co link. You can</p>
<p>learn more about the benefits of link shortening here.</span></p>

<p>our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A</p>

<p>when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose</p>
<p>to install another application through Twitter. Twitter uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make</p>
<p>inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done</p>
<p>earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers,</p>
<p>such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p>Widget Data</p>
<p>Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or</p>
<p>widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you</p>
<p>visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (<span style="background-color: red;">“</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span>Widget Data</p>
<p>Widget Data<span style="background-color: red;">”</span><span style="background-color: green;">"</span>). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting,</p>
<p>de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use</p>
<p>Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in.</p>
<p>Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit</p>
