<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes Twitter's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Twitter receives your</p>
<p>information through our various web sites, SMS, APIs, applications, services and third-parties ("Services"). For example, you send us information</p>
<p>when you use Twitter from our web site, post or receive Tweets via SMS, add a Twitter widget to your website, or access Twitter from an</p>
<p>application such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android or TweetDeck. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer,</p>
<p>manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you</p>
<p>reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Twitter in the United States or any other country where Twitter operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com.</p>
<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We collect and use your information to provide and measure use of our Services and improve them over time.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a Twitter account, you provide some personal information, such as</p>
<p>your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our</p>
<p>Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not</p>
<p>require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture.</p>
<p>You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that</p>
<p>we can help you find Twitter users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to</p>
<p>you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site.</p>
<p>If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional</p>
<p>information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.</p>
<p>Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and</p>
<p>the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as</p>
<p>favorites or Retweet and many other bits of information. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally</p>
<p>give you settings (http<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>://twitter.com/account/settings) to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and</p>
<p>instantly disseminated. For example, your public Tweets are searchable by many search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our</p>
<p>APIs (http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_faq) to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made</p>
<p>public by Twitter, not just your Tweets.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to note your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. If you turn on Tweeting with your</p>
<p>location, we may also save exact coordinates to help improve our service. You can control your location information settings in your account</p>
<p>settings (http<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>://twitter.com/account/settings).</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such</p>
<p>as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, and search terms. Other</p>
<p>actions, such as interactions with our website, applications and advertisements, may also be included in Log Data. If we havenâ€™t already deleted</p>
<p>the Log Data earlier, we will either delete it or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address,</p>
<p>after 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links in Tweets across our Services including third party services and clients by</p>
<p>redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click</p>
<p>statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not</p>
<p>require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is</p>
<p>transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact</p>
<p>with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet</p>
<p>browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before</p>
<p>accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> Twitter uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs</p>
<p>and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your</p>
<p>browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>Tip </p>
<p>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client or application to</p>
<p>access your Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal</p>
<p>information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to</p>
<p>obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or</p>
<p>legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information</p>
<p>may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new</p>
<p>entity.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information,</p>
<p>such as your public Tweets or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>
<p>Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and</p>
<p>associated with your account.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here (https://support.twitter.com/articles/15358-how-to-</p>
<p>deactivate-your-account), your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com.</p>
<p>For up to 30 days it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process</p>
<p>of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Our Policy Towards Children</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your</p>
<p>consent, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become</p>
<p>aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always</p>
<p>be at http<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter</p>
<p>update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective,</p>
<p>you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
