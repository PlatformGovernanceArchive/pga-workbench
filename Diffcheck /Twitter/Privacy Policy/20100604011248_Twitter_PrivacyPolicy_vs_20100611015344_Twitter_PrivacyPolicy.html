<p><strong>Twitter Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes Twitter's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Twitter</p>
<p>receives your information through our various web sites, SMS, APIs, services and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our</p>
<p>Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as</p>
<p>described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be</p>
<p>used by Twitter in the United States or any other country where Twitter operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a Twitter account, you provide some personal</p>
<p>information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and</p>
<p>username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as</p>
<p>search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location,</p>
<p>or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or</p>
<p>your address book so that we can help you find Twitter users you know. We may use your contact information to send you</p>
<p>information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions</p>
<p>contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address</p>
<p>and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely</p>
<p>optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with</p>
<p>the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the</p>
<p>messages you Tweet and the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the</p>
<p>people you follow, the Tweets you mark as favorites or Retweet and many other bits of information. Our default is almost always to</p>
<p>make the information you provide public but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your</p>
<p>public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public Tweets are searchable by many search</p>
<p>engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about</p>
<p>all information that will be made public by Twitter, not just your Tweets.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to note your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. If you turn on Tweeting with</p>
<p>your location, we may also save exact coordinates to help improve our service. You can control your location information settings</p>
<p>in your account settings.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include</p>
<p>information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as</p>
<p>interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Links:</strong> Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links in Tweets by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to</p>
<p>help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a</p>
<p>particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong></span>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services,</p>
<p>but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A</p>
<p>cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent</p>
<p>cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing</p>
<p>on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser,</p>
<p>by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> Twitter uses <span style="background-color: green;">a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our</p>
<p>various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as </span>Google Analytics<span style="background-color: red;"> to help understand use of our Services</span>.
