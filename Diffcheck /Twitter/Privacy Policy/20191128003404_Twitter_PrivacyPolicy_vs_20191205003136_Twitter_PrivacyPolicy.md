**you take away from it:**<span style="background-color: green;">


**We have made some updates to our Privacy Policy. The updated**


**Privacy Policy will go into effect on January 1, 2020. You can**


**find a copy of the updated Privacy Policy at the top of this page**


**followed by the current Privacy Policy below.**


 </span>


**Twitter Privacy Policy**


**We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and**


**how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.**


**We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the**


**information that you share with us.**


**That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.**


 **Privacy Policy**



 


**Information You Share With Us**


**We require certain information to provide our services to you. For**


**example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content**


**on Twitter. When you choose to share the information below with us,**


**we collect and use it to operate our services.**


 


**1.1**


<span style="background-color: green;"> 




</span>**Basic Account Information**


You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles


or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some


personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter


Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display


name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also 


, for example to express different parts of your identity.

manage multiple Twitter accounts
</span>


**1.2**


**Public Information**


Most activity on Twitter is public, including your 


, your time zone and language, when you created your


account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter


you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create,


people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. <span style="background-color: green;">If you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise


publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad


with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. </span>Periscope broadcasts you create,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

<span style="background-color: green;">are </span>your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you


watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast


will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who


use our services may also be public. For example, other people may 


 (if your settings allow) or mention you


in a Tweet.


You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully


about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as


by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and


Twitter for Android.


<span style="background-color: green;">By publicly posting content when you Tweet, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including

</span>available in limited quantities for free<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>how this data can be used, and a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

**Contact Information and Address Books**


We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and


our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to <span style="background-color: red;">personalize our services,


</span>enable certain account<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>service<span style="background-color: green;">s, and to


personalize our services, including ad</span>s. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Twitter to that number as your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>client applications. You can use<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Twitter. You can also unsubscribe<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.


You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you


know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and


others.


You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your


Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,


friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.


You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.

**1.4**


**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications**


We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can


use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on


Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your


communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to


http://t.co URLs, 


<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> a<span style="background-color: red;">nd prohi</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">use and prohib</span>ited images, and <span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">us</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">view</span> of reported issues. We also use information about


whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of


our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of


your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a


way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,


those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that 


 of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -


which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.<span style="background-color: green;">

**Additional Information We Receive About You**


**We receive certain information when you use our services or other**


**websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from**


**third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with**


**us, we use the data below to operate our services.**


**2.1**


**Location Information**


We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device


settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.


Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current


precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more


relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location


here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope


<span style="background-color: green;"> 


 




</span>broadcasts here.<span style="background-color: red;">


 </span>


**2.2**


**Links**


<span style="background-color: red;"> 




</span>In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails


we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.


If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from


Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it


was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.


**2.3**


**Cookies**


A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and


similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many


parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept


cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to 


. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or<span style="background-color: red;"> device</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">device </span>allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services,<span style="background-color: red;"> to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to </span>monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account


security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not


support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.


 <span style="background-color: green;">

**2.4**


**Log Data**


We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”


even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our


email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter


content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,


operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and


application IDs), search terms<span style="background-color: green;"> (including those not submitted as queries)</span>, and cookie information. We also receive Log Data<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>when you click on, view, or interact with links<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>We use Log Data to operate our services and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Data to protect the security of accounts and to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>improve the content we show you, including ads<span style="background-color: green;"> and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing</span>.


We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences


like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better <span style="background-color: green;">promote and


</span>design our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.

</span>


**Twitter for Web Data**


When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet


buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the


use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We


do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,


obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be


located in the European Union or EFTA States.

</span>**2.6**


**Advertisers and Other Ad Partners**


Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to


help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you


ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device


IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of


our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by


integrating our advertising technolog<span style="background-color: green;">y. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the


websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that


Twitter receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Polic</span>y.


Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred


to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based


advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on


categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more


about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.


If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising


services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy


Policy.


<span style="background-color: green;"> 


</span>**2.7**


**Developers**


If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your


data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.


 


**2.8**


**Other Third Parties and Affiliates**


We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners


who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to


your Twitter account.


You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us


information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting


<span style="background-color: green;"> 


 



</span>or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke


this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have


connected to Twitter.<span style="background-color: red;">


 </span>


**2.9**


**Personalizing <span style="background-color: green;">Ba</span><span style="background-color: red;">Acro</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">ed On</span> Your <span style="background-color: red;">D</span><span style="background-color: green;">Inf</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">rr</span><span style="background-color: red;">vic</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">d Identity</span>**


When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes


such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with


<span style="background-color: red;"> 


 



</span>browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other


browsers or devices). W<span style="background-color: green;">hen you provide other information to Twitter, including an email address, we associate that


information with your Twitter account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other


information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common


components with the email address you have provided to Twitter. W</span>e do this to operate and personalize our services. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>example, if you visit websites with sports content<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Android<span style="background-color: green;"> and, if the email address associated with your account shares components with another email address, such as shared


first name, last name, or initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers that were trying to reach email


addresses containing those components</span>.


**2.10**


**How You Control Additional Information We Receive**


Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:


Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter


How we personalize <span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">your experience </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">cro</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">s d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">v</span><span style="background-color: green;">d on your </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">nf</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">rred identity</span>


Whether we <span style="background-color: red;">collect and </span>use your precise location<span style="background-color: green;"> history</span>


Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been


Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content


You can use Your Twitter data to review:


Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads


Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners


Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests


We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.


This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account


that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch


history through your settings.

</span>**Information We Share and Disclose**


**As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly**


**disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the**


**limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we**<span style="background-color: red;">

**3.1**


**Sharing You Control**


We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web


client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared


information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,


keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.


Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For


example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of


our advertising business. <span style="background-color: green;">Y</span><span style="background-color: red;">We als</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> share device identifiers, along with the interests or other characteristics of a device or the

**Service Providers**


We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries.


For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis,


and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with


such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and


security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant


to our instructions<span style="background-color: green;"> (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit)</span>. We share your payment<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certification.


If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us here. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if


you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal


complaint resolution process, alternatively through the independent dispute resolution body JAMS, and under certain


conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.


Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade


Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the

you agree



**You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope**


**you take away from it:**


**1** **The many sides of you:** Let your identify run free. Explore your interests with a number of different identities.


**2** **Hello, World:** Your profile information is displayed under your photo and username on your profile page.


**3** **Keep a low profile:** Friend want to tag you in a photo? Lucky you. If you're not into that sort of thing, you can always change your settings.


**4 Spam stinks:** We scan your Direct Messages to try and prevent spam for you and our service. 


**5 Just like email:** Only send Direct Messages to people you trust. Remember, even though someone can’t Retweet your Direct Messages, they still have a


copy of your message. 


**6 Approved by you:** We use your payment information to process transactions you’ve approved and for fraud detection.


**7 Not hungry?** You can change your cookie settings in your web browser. 


**8 Transparency matters:** We remove content from our services when it violates our rules, like if it glorifies violence. When that content is gone, we want


you to know. 


**9 You’re in control:** Even as Twitter evolves, you can always change your privacy settings. The power is yours to choose what you share in the world.


**We have made some updates to our Privacy Policy. The updated**


**Privacy Policy will go into effect on January 1, 2020. The current**


**Privacy Policy is below.**


**Twitter Privacy Policy**


**(Effective until January 1, 2020)**



**1. Information You Share With Us**


**We require certain information to provide our services to you. For**


**example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content**


**on Twitter. When you choose to share the information below with us,**


**we collect and use it to operate our services.**


**1.1**


**Basic Account Information**


You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles


or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some


personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter



Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display


name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also 


, for example to express different parts of your identity.


**1.2**


**Public Information**


Most activity on Twitter is public, including your 


, your time zone and language, when you created your


account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter


you Tweeted from. You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create,


people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. Periscope broadcasts you create, click


on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So are


your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you


watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast


will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who


use our services may also be public. For example, other people may 


 (if your settings allow) or mention you


in a Tweet.


You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully


about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as


by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and


Twitter for Android.


In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter, we also use technology like application


programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for


example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content


available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern


how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not


affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter. For more information about how we


make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.


**1.3**


**Contact Information and Address Books**


We use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and


our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to personalize our services,


enable certain account features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our


services. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your


country’s laws allow. Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help


others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. You can use


your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter. You can also unsubscribe


from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.


You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you


know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and


others.


You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your


Periscope account to these other services. If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address,


create and


manage multiple Twitter accounts


profile information


tag you in a photo



friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.


You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.


If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to


your request.


**1.4**


**Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications**


We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can


use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on


Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your


communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to


http://t.co URLs, 


 and prohibited images, and review of reported issues. We also use information about


whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of


our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of


your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a


way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet,


those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that 


 of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account -


which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.


**1.5**


**Payment Information**


You may provide us with 


, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code,


and billing address, in order to purchase advertising or other offerings provided as part of our services.


**1.6**


**How You Control the Information You Share with Us**


Your Privacy and safety settings let you decide:


Whether your Tweets are publicly available on Twitter


Whether others can tag you in a photo


Whether you will be able to receive Direct Messages from anyone on Twitter or just your followers


Whether others can find you based on your email or phone number


Whether you upload your address book to Twitter for storage and use


When and where you may see sensitive content on Twitter


Whether you want to block or mute other Twitter accounts

**2. Additional Information We Receive About You**


**We receive certain information when you use our services or other**


**websites or mobile applications that include our content, and from**


**third parties including advertisers. Like the information you share with**


**us, we use the data below to operate our services.**


**2.1**


**Location Information**


We require information about your signup and current location, which we get from signals such as your IP address or device


settings, to securely and reliably set up and maintain your account and to provide our services to you.


Subject to your settings, we may collect, use, and store additional information about your location - such as your current


precise position or places where you’ve previously used Twitter - to operate or personalize our services including with more


relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about Twitter’s use of location


here, and how to set your Twitter location preferences here. Learn more about how to share your location in Periscope


broadcasts here.


**2.2**


**Links**


In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services. This includes links in emails


we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.


If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from


Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it


was intended to reach. They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.


**2.3**


**Cookies**


A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and


similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many


parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept



cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to 


. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device


allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to


monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account


security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not


support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.


**2.4**


**Log Data**


We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,”


even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our


email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter


content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type,


operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and


application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links


on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to operate our services and


ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to


determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads.


We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences


like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better design our


services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.


**2.5**


**Twitter for Web Data**


When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet


buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the


use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We


do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete,


obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be


located in the European Union or EFTA States.


**2.6**


**Advertisers and Other Ad Partners**


Advertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to


help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you


ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device


IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of


our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by


integrating our advertising technology.


Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred


to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based


place a cookie on


your computer



advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on


categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more


about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.


If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising


services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy


Policy.


**2.7**


**Developers**


If you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your


data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.


**2.8**


**Other Third Parties and Affiliates**


We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners


who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to


your Twitter account.


You may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us


information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting


or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke


this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have


connected to Twitter.


**2.9**


**Personalizing Across Your Devices**


When you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes


such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with


browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other


browsers or devices). We do this to operate and personalize our services. For example, if you visit websites with sports content


on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android.


**2.10**


**How You Control Additional Information We Receive**


Your Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:


Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter


How we personalize your experience across devices


•


•



Whether we collect and use your precise location


Whether we personalize your experience based on where you’ve been


Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content


You can use Your Twitter data to review:


Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads


Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners


Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests


We also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don’t have a Twitter account, or if you’re logged out of your account.


This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account


that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch


history through your settings.

**3. Information We Share and Disclose**


**As noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly**


**disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the**


**limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we**


**do so subject to your control, because it’s necessary to operate our**


**services, or because it’s required by law.**


**3.1**


**Sharing You Control**


We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web


client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared


information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service,


keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.


Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For


example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of


our advertising business. We also share device identifiers, along with the interests or other characteristics of a device or the


person using it, to help partners decide whether to serve an ad to that device or to enable them to conduct marketing, brand



analysis, interest-based advertising, or similar activities. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and


you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in this way by using the “Share your data with Twitter’s business


partners” option in your Personalization and Data settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our


Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our service providers.) The information we share with these partners does not


include your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter username, but some of these partnerships allow the information


we share to be linked to other personal information if the partner gets your consent first.


**3.2**


**Service Providers**


We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries.


For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis,
