<p>Twitter Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Our Services instantly connect people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to them. Any registered user of the Twitter Services</p>
<p>can send a Tweet, which is a message of 140 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like photos,</p>
<p>videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy</p>
<p>Policy”) describes how and when Twitter collects, uses and shares your information when you use our</p>
<p>Services. Twitter receives your information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons,</p>
<p>widgets, ads, commerce services (the “Twitter Services</p>
<p>Twitter Services”), and our other covered services that link to this Policy (collectively, the</p>
<p>“Services</p>
<p>Services”) and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the</p>
<p>web, via SMS, or from an application such as Twitter for Mac, Twitter for Android or TweetDeck. When using any of our Services you</p>
<p>consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you live in the United States, your information is controlled by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA</p>
<p>94103 U.S.A. If you live outside the United States, the data controller responsible for your information is Twitter International</p>
<p>Company, an Irish company with its registered office at The Academy, 42 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. Irrespective of which</p>
<p>country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Twitter to use your information in the United States, Ireland, and</p>
<p>any other country where Twitter operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us here or at privacy@twitter.com.</p>
<p>Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Basic Account Information</p>
<p>Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your</p>
<p>name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On the Twitter Services, your name and username are listed publicly,</p>
<p>including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Twitter Services,</p>
<p>such as searching and viewing public user profiles, do not require registration.</p>
<p>Contact Information</p>
<p>Contact Information: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your</p>
<p>account or enable Services, for example, for login verification, Twitter via SMS, or Digits by Twitter. If you provide Twitter with your</p>
<p>phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from Twitter. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or</p>
<p>login to a third-party application, you are directing Twitter to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that</p>
<p>application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent</p>
<p>spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may</p>
<p>use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Twitter Services. You may also</p>
<p>unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website.</p>
<p>Your privacy settings control whether others can find you on the Twitter Services by your email address or phone number.</p>
<p>Additional Information</p>
<p>Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Twitter Services, such as a short</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : What you say on the Twitter Services may be viewed all around the world instantly. You are what you Tweet!</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sign in</p>
<p>Language: English </p>
<p>biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find</p>
<p>users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address</p>
<p>book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. Learn more here. If you email us, we may keep</p>
<p>your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to</p>
<p>your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your</p>
<p>registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting,</p>
<p>helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your</p>
<p>account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
<p>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information</p>
<p>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information</p>
<p>with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Twitter Services is information you are asking us to make public.</p>
<p>Your public information includes the messages you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the</p>
<p>client application you used to Tweet; the language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create,</p>
<p>people you follow, Tweets you mark as likes or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Twitter</p>
<p>Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content</p>
<p>we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Twitter Services public</p>
<p>for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like direct messages, to make the information</p>
<p>more private if you want. The Twitter Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users,</p>
<p>customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are immediately delivered via SMS</p>
<p>and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter</p>
<p>content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends</p>
<p>and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about</p>
<p>what you are making public.</p>
<p>Location Information</p>
<p>Location Information: Twitter may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your</p>
<p>location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on</p>
<p>Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS,</p>
<p>information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information</p>
<p>about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the</p>
<p>Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more</p>
<p>about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>Links: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party</p>
<p>services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide</p>
<p>more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve</p>
<p>our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A</p>
<p>cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Twitter may use both session cookies and</p>
<p>persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web</p>
<p>traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from</p>
<p>the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use</p>
<p>cookies and similar technologies here.</p>
<p>Log Data</p>
<p>Log Data: When you use our Services, we may receive information (“Log Data</p>
<p>Log Data”) such as your IP address, browser type,</p>
<p>operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and</p>
<p>application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example,</p>
<p>when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-</p>
<p>party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. We may also receive Log Data</p>
<p>when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose</p>
<p>to install another application through Twitter. Twitter uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make</p>
<p>inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done</p>
<p>earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers,</p>
<p>such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p>Widget Data</p>
<p>Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or</p>
<p>widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you</p>
<p>visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (“Widget Data</p>
<p>Widget Data”). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting,</p>
<p>de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use</p>
<p>Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in.</p>
<p>Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit</p>
<p>information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other</p>
<p>information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Commerce Services</p>
<p>Commerce Services: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration</p>
<p>date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, “Payment Information</p>
<p>Payment Information”), along with your shipping address, to complete a</p>
<p>commerce transaction through our Services. You may also provide your credit or debit card number to register for card-linked</p>
<p>services, such as offers. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping</p>
<p>address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information</p>
<p>and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your</p>
<p>purchases made through our Services (“Transaction Data</p>
<p>Transaction Data”). If you register your credit or debit card with Twitter for card-linked</p>
<p>services, we receive information about the card transactions from a third-party payment services provider or card network</p>
<p>(“Registered Card Data</p>
<p>Registered Card Data”). Transaction Data and Registered Card Data may include the merchant’s name and the date, time and</p>
<p>amount of the transaction. Twitter uses Registered Card Data to verify eligibility for card-linked services, and may also use</p>
<p>Registered Card Data to limit the number of offers available to you and keep track of your offers.</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates</p>
<p>Third-Parties and Affiliates: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our</p>
<p>various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-</p>
<p>party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP</p>
<p>address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or</p>
<p>cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this</p>
<p>allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services. If you prefer, you can turn off</p>
<p>tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account will not be matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring</p>
<p>ads. Learn more about your privacy options here and about how ads work on our Services here. We may also receive information</p>
<p>about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services,</p>
<p>including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction</p>
<p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-</p>
<p>party web client or application to access your account. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they</p>
<p>mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo on the Twitter</p>
<p>Services. If you’ve shared information, like direct messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses the Twitter</p>
<p>Services through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>
<p>Service Providers</p>
<p>Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland,</p>
<p>and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent</p>
<p>with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third</p>
<p>parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with</p>
<p>payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Tip : We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
<p>dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.</p>
<p>We may share your credit or debit card number with payment services providers or card networks to monitor card transactions at</p>
<p>participating merchants and track redemption activity for the purposes of providing card-linked services.</p>
<p>Sellers of Goods and Services</p>
<p>Sellers of Goods and Services: If you buy goods or services through our Services, we may provide the seller, commerce</p>
<p>provider or marketplace with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate</p>
<p>payment processing, order fulfilment and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent,</p>
<p>detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties’ privacy policies for information about</p>
<p>their privacy practices.</p>
<p>Law and Harm</p>
<p>Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we</p>
<p>believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the</p>
<p>safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter’s rights or property. However, nothing in</p>
<p>this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a</p>
<p>government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates</p>
<p>Business Transfers and Affiliates: In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or</p>
<p>sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your</p>
<p>information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help</p>
<p>provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p>N on-Private or N on-Personal Information</p>
<p>N on-Private or N on-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-</p>
<p>personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the</p>
<p>number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or</p>
<p>clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p>
<p>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the</p>
<p>personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information,</p>
<p>including your Tweets, by following the instructions here and request access to additional information here.</p>
<p>You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and</p>
<p>then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still</p>
<p>possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and</p>
<p>Twitter to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which</p>
<p>can take up to a week.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile</p>
<p>information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account.</p>
