Entire Agreement


This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between SOUNDCLOUD and USER with respect to

Right of Revocation (German: “Widerrufsrecht”)


If USER is a consumer in the European Union, USER may cancel registration for the free or premium account in text


form (by email, letter or fax) without stating a reason within 14 days of registration. Furthermore, USER may cancel


registration for the premium account in writing (by email, letter or fax) within 14 days without stating a reason, after


changing from a free account to a premium account. The two-week periods begin with the reception of this


information in text form. For exercising this right it is sufficient to send the cancellation of the Agreement to the


following address:


SoundCloud Ltd. 


Rosenthaler Straße 13

contact@soundcloud.com


In the event of a valid cancellation, both parties shall be obliged to restore any benefits already received in accordance


with legal provisions, and issue any gains (e.g. interest). If USER is unable or partially unable to restore the benefits,


or only able to restore them in poor condition, to SOUNDCLOUD, USER shall be obligated to reimburse


SOUNDCLOUD for the corresponding value. USER may avoid the duty to reimburse by not using the benefits as his


own and by ceasing to do anything that affects the value of the benefit. Each party must fulfill its obligation for


reimbursement within thirty (30) days. The deadline begins for USER with the sending of the cancellation; for


SOUNDCLOUD with the reception of the cancellation sent by USER. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to revoke


the Agreement expires if both parties fulfilled their contractual obligations upon USER’s explicit consent before USER
