<p>By accessing or using the Platform, registering an account, or by viewing, accessing, streaming, uploading or</p>

<p>When we make any updates to these Terms of Use, we will highlight this fact on the Website. In addition, if you</p>
<p>register an account and these Terms of Use are subsequently changed in any material respect (for example, for</p>
<p>security, legal, or regulatory reasons), we will notify you in advance by sending a message to your SoundCloud®</p>
<p>account and an email to the email address that you have provided to us, and the revised Terms of Use will become</p>
<p>effective six (6) weeks after such notification. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any</p>
<p>such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation</p>
<p>section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that six (6) week</p>
<p>period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Description of the Platform</p>
<p>The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos,</p>
<p>pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (“<strong>Content</strong>”), which will be stored by SoundCloud</p>
<p>at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other</p>
<p>users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Services and accessible via the Website</p>
<p>and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to</p>
<p>discussions, and enables any user of the Website or certain Services (whether or not registered users of the</p>
<p>Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, or other services and/or features for the</p>
<p>Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use</p>
<p>that we may release for those specific services or features.</p>
<p>Your SoundCloud Account</p>
<p>You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to certain Services is only available to registered</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p>When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and</p>
<p>password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your</p>
<p>email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our</p>
<p>Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you</p>
<p>will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,</p>
<p>whether or not such activity was authorized by you.</p>
<p>If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized</p>
<p>third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest</p>
<p>possible opportunity.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames in appropriate circumstances, as</p>
<p>determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if</p>
<p>activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of</p>
<p>Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable</p>
<p>laws or regulations.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section below.</p>
<p>Any attempt to terminate your account by means other than those described in the Termination and Right of</p>
<p>Cancellation section will not be considered a proper termination.</p>
<p>Once your account has been terminated or cancelled, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to</p>
<p>activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be</p>
<p>irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data</p>
<p>or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our</p>
<p>legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account</p>
<p>before terminating or cancelling your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably</p>
<p>deleted following any cancellation of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar</p>
<p>file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This</p>
<p>data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account</p>
<p>is active.</p>
<p>Your Use of the Platform</p>
<p>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms of Use and our Community Guidelines, SoundCloud grants you a</p>
<p>limited, personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable and non-transferable right and licence to use the</p>
<p>Platform in order to view Content uploaded and posted to the Website, to listen to audio Content streamed from the</p>
<p>Platform and to share and download audio Content where the appropriate functionality has been enabled by the user</p>
<p>who uploaded the relevant Content (the “<strong>Uploader</strong>”).</p>
<p>In addition, if you register to use the Platform, and subject to your strict compliance with these Terms of Use and our</p>

<p>(xi) You must not make use of any bots, botnets, automated scripts, apps, plugins or extensions or other automated</p>

<p>creating, or purchasing accounts, or behavior, to artificially increase popularity</p>
<p>mass private sharing of track(s)</p>
<p>repeatedly hitting action limitations</p>
<p>You agree to comply with the above conditions, and acknowledge and agree that SoundCloud has the right, in its sole</p>
<p>discretion, to terminate your account or take such other action as we see fit if you breach the above conditions or any</p>
<p>of the other terms of these Terms of Use. This may include taking court action and/or to report offending users to the</p>
<p>relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Your Content</p>
<p>Any and all audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information that you upload,</p>
<p>store, transmit, submit, exchange or make available to or via the Platform (hereinafter "<strong>Your Content</strong>") is generated,</p>
<p>owned and controlled solely by you, and not by SoundCloud.</p>
<p>SoundCloud does not claim any ownership rights in Your Content, and you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree</p>

<p>Without prejudice to the conditions set forth in Your Use of the Platform, you must not upload, store, distribute, send,</p>
<p>transmit, display, perform, make available or otherwise communicate to the public any Content to which you do not</p>
<p>hold the necessary rights. In particular, <strong>any unauthorized use of copyright protected material within Your Content</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including by way of reproduction, distribution, modification, adaptation, public display, public performance,</strong></p>
<p><strong>preparation of derivative works, making available or otherwise communicating to the public via the Platform) may</strong></p>
<p><strong>constitute an infringement of third party rights and is</strong> <strong><em>strictly prohibited</em></strong>. Any such infringements may result in</p>
<p>termination of your access to the Platform as described in the Repeat Infringers section below, and may also result in</p>
<p>civil litigation or criminal prosecution by or on behalf of the relevant rightsholder.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, invite or provide you with means to provide feedback regarding the Platform, and in such</p>
<p>circumstances, any feedback you provide will be deemed non-confidential and SoundCloud shall have the right, but</p>
<p>not the obligation, to use such feedback on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>Grant of Licence</p>
<p>By uploading or posting Your Content to the Platform, you initiate an automated process to transcode any audio</p>
<p>Content and direct SoundCloud to store Your Content on our servers, from where you may control and authorise the</p>
<p>use, reproduction, transmission, distribution, public display, public performance, making available and other</p>
<p>communication to the public of Your Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the extent it is</p>
<p>necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any</p>
<p>of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences</p>
<p>to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.</p>
<p>By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid</p>
<p>up, licence to other users of the Platform, and to users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your</p>
<p>Content has been shared or embedded using the Services (“<strong>Linked Services</strong>”), to use, copy, transmit or otherwise</p>
<p>distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, prepare derivative works of, make available and otherwise communicate</p>
<p>to the public Your Content within the parameters set by you using the Services. You can limit and restrict the</p>
<p>availability of certain of Your Content to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services, at any time using</p>
<p>the settings on the sound page for each sound you upload, subject to the provisions of the Disclaimer section below.</p>
<p>The licences granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of Your Content that you upload</p>
<p>to the Platform. Licences with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the</p>
<p>following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your</p>
<p>account. Licences with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Website will be perpetual</p>
<p>and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account.</p>
<p>Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from</p>
<p>SoundCloud’s systems and servers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree</p>
<p>that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, SoundCloud is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your</p>
<p>Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the</p>
<p>Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content.</p>
<p>Any Content other than Your Content is the property of the relevant Uploader, and is or may be subject to copyright,</p>
<p>trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such Content may not be downloaded, reproduced,</p>

<p>receives more than two of these warnings within any twelve month period is liable to have their access to the Platform</p>
<p>terminated forthwith.</p>
<p>We will also suspend or terminate your account without warning if ordered to do so by a court, and/or in other</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion.</p>

<p>Data Protection and Privacy</p>
<p>All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used and</p>

<p>Meetups</p>
<p>SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues</p>
<p>all over the world (“<strong>Meetups</strong>”). While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded</p>
<p>promotional materials to help organisers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any</p>
<p>way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups</p>
<p>is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any</p>
<p>SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.</p>
<p>Competitions and Other Promotions</p>
<p>From time to time, some SoundCloud® users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar</p>
<p>opportunities on the Platform (“<strong>Third Party Competitions</strong>”). SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third</p>
<p>Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who</p>
<p>organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any of promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If you wish to</p>
<p>participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions</p>
<p>applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility</p>
<p>requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.</p>
<p>Use of SoundCloud Player and Widget</p>
<p>The Services include the ability for users to embed the SoundCloud waveform player and a fully customisable player</p>
<p>(“<strong>Widget</strong>”) into other websites, including without limitation, their own website or a third party website or social media</p>
<p>profile, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content</p>
<p>wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters</p>
<p>set by the Uploader.</p>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, embed the waveform player or use the Widget in such a</p>
<p>way that you aggregate Content from the Platform (other than Your Content) into a separate destination that replicates</p>
<p>substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a</p>
<p>material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the waveform player or</p>
<p>Widget to embed Content (other than Your Content) into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular</p>
<p>artist or genre, or use the waveform player or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist or other</p>
<p>third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the waveform player or Widget. The foregoing shall apply</p>
<p>whether or not such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Premium Accounts</p>
<p>Certain features of the Platform are only available to users who register and pay for a premium account. A detailed</p>
<p>description of our premium accounts, including the prices and the features associated with each type of account, is</p>
<p>available here.</p>
<p>Fees for premium accounts are payable at the commencement of the subscription period, and your first payment will</p>
<p>be taken at the time the contract is concluded unless stated otherwise. If you choose any of our monthly accounts,</p>
<p>your account will renew automatically at the end of each monthly period, and payment for the next monthly period will</p>
<p>be taken at that time, unless and until you cancel or terminate your account in the manner described in the</p>
<p>Termination and Right of Cancellation section below. Annual accounts run for twelve months from the date on which</p>
<p>the contract is concluded, and will expire automatically at the end of that twelve month period unless you elect to</p>
<p>renew your subscription. If you renew your annual subscription, payment for the next twelve month period will be taken</p>
<p>at the time you renew.</p>
<p>Payments are due without the need for an invoice, and can be made by Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. All payments</p>
<p>include VAT or other sales tax where applicable. If a credit card processor imposes handling charges in order to</p>
<p>process your payment, we may add such charges to the total amount paid for the service – handling charges are</p>
<p>typically 1% to 3% of the amount to be paid.</p>
<p>If you have a gift code, simply add this in the “Your Promo Code” box during the premium account registration</p>
<p>process. Gift codes should be used within three years. SoundCloud is unable to offer any kind of refund or exchange</p>
<p>for any gift code not redeemed within this period.</p>
<p>Once payment has been made or the gift code accepted, we will send a confirmation email to the email address</p>
<p>provide by you as part of the registration process. Until you receive this confirmation email, no contract is concluded.</p>
<p>Completion of the registration process is merely an offer to conclude a contract, and does not constitute the</p>
<p>conclusion of a contract. The language of the contract is English.</p>
<p>If you wish to upgrade your account, you may do so at any time. If you wish to downgrade your account, you may do so</p>
<p>at the end of your then current subscription period.</p>
<p>Consumers in the European Union have a right to cancel premium accounts for a period of fourteen (14) days after</p>
<p>they are concluded. Details are provided below in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section.</p>
<p>Changes to the Platform, Accounts and Pricing</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to change, modify, withdraw or discontinue any of the features, services and</p>
<p>functionalities of the Platform at any time and for any reason with or without notice. SoundCloud also reserves the</p>
<p>right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or</p>
<p>any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In</p>
<p>the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access,</p>
<p>SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavours to notify registered users of such decision in advance.</p>
<p>You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents,</p>
<p>directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to</p>
<p>the Website and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to</p>
<p>suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or</p>
<p>access the same from or within any territory or territories.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new types of account at</p>
<p>any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its premium accounts from time to time. In</p>
<p>the event of any change(s) to the pricing or features of any premium account to which you have subscribed, such</p>
<p>change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your</p>
<p>subscription. In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of account to which you</p>
<p>subscribe, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed</p>
<p>changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and an email to the then current email address that</p>
<p>we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform</p>
<p>following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of</p>
<p>Cancellation section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that</p>
<p>six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your account.</p>
<p>Termination and Right of Cancellation (“Widerrufsrecht”)</p>
<p>Termination:</p>
<p>You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rosenthalerstr. 13,</p>
<ol>
<li>Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, by deleting</li>
</ol>
<p>your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a premium account, then we will cease to</p>
<p>charge you from the first day of the month following receipt of notice of termination from you, but cannot offer any</p>
<p>refund for any unexpired period of your subscription.</p>
<p>SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are</p>
<p>deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: Your</p>
<p>Use of the Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence , and Your Representations and Warranties; (iii) SoundCloud</p>
<p>elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where</p>
<p>you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at</p>
<p>its discretion.</p>
<p>Cancellation:</p>
<p>In addition, if you are a consumer in the European Union, you will have fourteen (14) days in which to cancel any</p>
<p>account that you may have registered with us, or any gift code that you may have purchased. You should contact us by</p>
<p>email, letter or fax to confirm your cancellation, but do not have to provide any reason for your cancellation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you upgrade from a free to a premium account, you have fourteen (14) days from the date of your</p>
<p>upgrade in which to cancel your premium account. Again, you should contact us by email, letter or fax, but do not have</p>
<p>to provide any reason for your cancellation.</p>
<p>In either case, the fourteen (14) day cancellation period begins with the date on which the registration of your acount</p>
<p>or your upgrade, or the purchase of your gift code, is confirmed.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation, you should contact us at:</p>

<p>contact@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>If you cancel a premium account or gift code purchase in accordance with this process, we will refund you for any</p>
<p>payments you have made with respect to your premium account or gift code purchase, and will do so within thirty (30)</p>
<p>days of the date of receipt of your valid notice of cancellation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware that you will lose your right to cancel your account, if you have logged into your account or</strong></p>
<p><strong>redeemed your gift code during the fourteen (14) day cancellation period.</strong></p>
<p>For consumers in Germany, your right of revocation is known as widerruftsrecht. Further information about this right is</p>
<p>available in German at http://soundcloud.com/premium/widerrufsrecht.</p>
<p>Following receipt of your notice of cancellation, SoundCloud will delete your account and all associated Content and</p>
<p>data. You are therefore advised to remove, copy or back up any Content in your account before sending us your notice</p>
<p>of cancellation.</p>
