SoundCloud Terms of Use


Welcome to SoundCloud®, a service provided by SoundCloud Limited (“**SoundCloud**”, “**we**”<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>“**our**”, or “**us**”).


These Terms of Use govern your use of SoundCloud.com (the “**Website**”), and all related players, widgets, tools,


apps, data, software, APIs (which may also be subject to separate API Terms of Use) and other services provided by


SoundCloud (the “**Services**”).


These Terms of Use, together with our Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines, constitute a legally binding


agreement (the “**Agreement**”) between you and SoundCloud in relation to your use of the Website and the Services


(together, the “**Platform**”).


These Terms of Use are divided into the following sections:

agree to abide by them.


Changes to Terms of Use


This section explains that our Terms of Use may change from time to time.

This section deals with ownership of your content, and includes your agreement not to upload anything that


infringes on anyone else’s rights.

uploading your content - for example, the right for other users to listen to your sounds.

in particular, your promise that everything you upload and share is owned by you and won’t infringe anyone else’s


rights.

upload to SoundCloud®.


Reporting Infringements


This section explains how to notify us of any content on SoundCloud® that you believe infringes your copyright or

Community Guidelines. You can find further information on reporting copyright infringement on our Copyright


Information pages.


Third Party Websites and Services


Through SoundCloud® you may have access to other websites and services. This section explains that these are


separate third party services that are not under the control of SoundCloud.


Blocking and Removal of Content<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>


This section makes it clear that SoundCloud may block or remove content from the Platform.


Repeat Infringers


Users who repeatedly infringe third party rights or breach our Community Guidelines risk having their

This section explains some of those things that SoundCloud will not be liable for. Please make sure you read and


understand this section.


Indemnification


If you use the Platform in a way that results in damage to us, you will need to take responsibility for that.

stored and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy, so please make sure that you read and understand that


policy.

our players to create a new music streaming service.

By accessing or using the Platform, registering an account, or by viewing, accessing, streaming, uploading or


downloading any information or content from or to the Platform, you represent and warrant that you have read and


understood the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines, will abide by them, and that you are either


18 years of age or more, or you are 13 years of age or more and have your parent(s)’ or legal guardian(s)’ permission


to use the Platform.


Changes to Terms of Use


We reserve the right to change, alter, replace or otherwise modify these Terms of Use, and our Community


Guidelines and Privacy Policy, at any time. The date of last modification is stated at the end of these Terms of Use. It


is your responsibility to check this page from time to time for updates.


When we make any updates to these Terms of Use, we will highlight this fact on the Website. In addition, if you


register an account and these Terms of Use are subsequently changed in any material respect (for example, for


security, legal, or regulatory reasons), we will notify you in advance by sending a message to your SoundCloud®


account and an email to the email address that you have provided to us, and the revised Terms of Use will become


effective six (6) weeks after such notification. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any


such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation


section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that six (6) week


period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.


Description of the Platform


The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos,


pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (“**Content**”), which will be stored by SoundCloud


at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other


users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Services and accessible via the Website


and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to


discussions, and enables any user of the Website or certain Services (whether or not registered users of the


Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.


We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, or other services and/or features for the


Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use


that we may release for those specific services or features.


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>Your SoundCloud Account


You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to certain Services is only available to registered


users.<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>


When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and


password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your


email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our


Privacy Policy.


You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you


will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,


whether or not such activity was authorized by you.


If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized


third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest


possible opportunity.


We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames in appropriate circumstances, as


determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if


activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of


Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable


laws or regulations.


You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section below.


Any attempt to terminate your account by means other than those described in the Termination and Right of


Cancellation section will not be considered a proper termination.


Once your account has been terminated or cancelled, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to


activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be


irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data


or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our


legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account


before terminating or cancelling your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably


deleted following any cancellation of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar


file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This


data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account


is active.

Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms of Use and our Community Guidelines, SoundCloud grants you a


limited, personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable and non-transferable right and licence to use the


Platform in order to view Content uploaded and posted to the Website, to listen to audio Content streamed from the

Indemnification


You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SoundCloud, its successors, assigns, affiliates, agents,


directors, officers, employees and shareholders from and against any and all claims, obligations, damages, losses,


expenses, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from:


<span style="background-color: green;">(</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">)</span> any violation by you of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines;


<span style="background-color: green;">(</span>ii<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">)</span> any third party claim of infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights or invasion of privacy arising


from the hosting of Your Content on the Platform, and/or your making available thereof to other users of the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Platform,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>and/or the actual use of Your Content by other users of the Platform or Linked Services in accordance<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>with these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Terms of Use and the parameters set by you with respect to the distribution and sharing of Your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Content;


<span style="background-color: green;">(</span>iii<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">)</span> any activity related to your account, be it by you or by any other person accessing your account with or without<span style="background-color: red;">


your</span> <span style="background-color: green;">your


</span>consent.


Data Protection and Privacy


All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used and


disclosed by SoundCloud in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By accepting these Terms of Use and using the


Platform, you also accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.


Meetups


SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues


all over the world (“**Meetups**”). While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>promotional materials to help organisers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any


way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups


is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any


SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.


Competitions and Other Promotions


From time to time, some SoundCloud® users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar


opportunities on the Platform (“**Third Party Competitions**”). SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third


Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who


organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any of promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If you wish to


participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions


applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility


requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.


Use of SoundCloud Player and Widget


The Services include the ability for users to embed the SoundCloud waveform player and a fully customisable player


(“**Widget**”) into other websites, including without limitation, their own website or a third party website or social media


profile, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content


wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters


set by the Uploader.


You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, embed the waveform player or use the Widget in such a


way that you aggregate Content from the Platform (other than Your Content) into a separate destination that replicates


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a


material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the waveform player or


Widget to embed Content (other than Your Content) into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular


artist or genre, or use the waveform player or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist or other


third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the waveform player or Widget. The foregoing shall apply


whether or not such use is commercial or non-commercial.


SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.


Premium Accounts


Certain features of the Platform are only available to users who register and pay for a premium account. A detailed


description of our premium accounts, including the prices and the features associated with each type of account, is


available here.


Fees for premium accounts are payable at the commencement of the subscription period, and your first payment will


be taken at the time the contract is concluded unless stated otherwise. If you choose any of our monthly accounts,


your account will renew automatically at the end of each monthly period, and payment for the next monthly period will


be taken at that time, unless and until you cancel or terminate your account in the manner described in the


Termination and Right of Cancellation section below. Annual accounts run for twelve months from the date on which


the contract is concluded, and will expire automatically at the end of that twelve month period unless you elect to


renew your subscription. If you renew your annual subscription, payment for the next twelve month period will be taken


at the time you renew.


Payments are due without the need for an invoice, and can be made by Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. All payments


include VAT or other sales tax where applicable. If a credit card processor imposes handling charges in order to


process your payment, we may add such charges to the total amount paid for the service – handling charges are


typically 1% to 3% of the amount to be paid.


If you have a gift code, simply add this in the “Your Promo Code” box during the premium account registration


process. Gift codes should be used within three years. SoundCloud is unable to offer any kind of refund or exchange


for any gift code not redeemed within this period.


Once payment has been made or the gift code accepted, we will send a confirmation email to the email address


provide by you as part of the registration process. Until you receive this confirmation email, no contract is concluded.


Completion of the registration process is merely an offer to conclude a contract, and does not constitute the


conclusion of a contract. The language of the contract is English.


If you wish to upgrade your account, you may do so at any time. If you wish to downgrade your account, you may do so


at the end of your then current subscription period.


Consumers in the European Union have a right to cancel premium accounts for a period of fourteen (14) days after


they are concluded. Details are provided below in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section.


Changes to the Platform, Accounts and Pricing


SoundCloud reserves the right to change, modify, withdraw or discontinue any of the features, services and


functionalities of the Platform at any time and for any reason with or without notice. SoundCloud also reserves the


right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or


any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In


the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access,


SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavours to notify registered users of such decision in advance.<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents,


directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to


the Website and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to


suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or


access the same from or within any territory or territories.


SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new types of account at


any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its premium accounts from time to time. In


the event of any change(s) to the pricing or features of any premium account to which you have subscribed, such


change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your


subscription. In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of account to which you


subscribe, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed


changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and an email to the then current email address that


we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform


following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of


Cancellation section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that


six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your account.


Termination and Right of Cancellation (“Widerrufsrecht”)


Termination:


You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to SoundCloud at Rosenthalerstr. 13,


10119<span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, by deleting


your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a premium account, then we will cease to


charge you from the first day of the month following receipt of notice of termination from you, but cannot offer any


refund for any unexpired period of your subscription.


SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are


deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these


Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: Your


Use of the Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>, and Your Representations and Warranties; (iii) SoundCloud


elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>


you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by SoundCloud at


its discretion.


Cancellation:


In addition, if you are a consumer in the European Union, you will have fourteen (14) days in which to cancel any


account that you may have registered with us, or any gift code that you may have purchased. You should contact us by


email, letter or fax to confirm your cancellation, but do not have to provide any reason for your cancellation.


Furthermore, if you upgrade from a free to a premium account, you have fourteen (14) days from the date of your


upgrade in which to cancel your premium account. Again, you should contact us by email, letter or fax, but do not have


to provide any reason for your cancellation.


In either case, the fourteen (14) day cancellation period begins with the date on which the registration of your acount


or your upgrade, or the purchase of your gift code, is confirmed.


If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation, you should contact us at:


SoundCloud Ltd. 


Rosenthaler Straße 13 


10119 Berlin<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>


Fax: +49 30 24 78 1001 


contact@soundcloud.com


If you cancel a premium account or gift code purchase in accordance with this process, we will refund you for any


payments you have made with respect to your premium account or gift code purchase, and will do so within thirty (30)


days of the date of receipt of your valid notice of cancellation.


**Please be aware that you will lose your right to cancel your account, if you have logged into your account or**


**redeemed your gift code during the fourteen (14) day cancellation period.**


For consumers in Germany, your right of revocation is known as widerruftsrecht. Further information about this right is


available in German at http://soundcloud.com/premium/widerrufsrecht.


Following receipt of your notice of cancellation, SoundCloud will delete your account and all associated Content and


data. You are therefore advised to remove, copy or back up any Content in your account before sending us your notice


of cancellation.


The provisions of these Terms of Use that are intended by their nature to survive the termination or cancellation of this


Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those Sections entitled Your


SoundCloud Account, Your Content, Grant of Licence<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>, Representations and Warranties, Liability for Content,
