<p>Description of Service</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>acknowledges to use SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services at own risk.</p>
<p>User Account</p>
<ol>
<li>When USER registers for SOUNDCLOUD’s Services, USER may choose a username and password and will</li>
</ol>
<p>receive a user account from SOUNDCLOUD. The USER is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality</p>
<p>and security of his/her username, password and account, and shall be responsible for all uses of his/her</p>
<p>username and password, whether or not authorized by USER.</p>
<ol>
<li>USER shall be liable for all activities and transactions occurring under USER’s account, except for damages</li>
</ol>
<p>caused by the gross negligent or intentional conduct of SOUNDCLOUD.</p>
<ol>
<li>USER shall notify SOUNDCLOUD immediately in writing of any unauthorized use of USER’s account including,</li>
</ol>
<p>without limitation, unauthorized use of USER’s password and/or username, or any other breach of confidentiality</p>

<ol>
<li>It is strictly prohibited to make use of any electronic tools, including spiders, robots (bots), crawlers, data mining</li>

</ol>
<p>account if and when activities occur on that account which constitute, at SOUNDCLOUD’s reasonable</p>

<p>regulations or third party rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>USER can cancel his/her account at any time in the profile settings. USER is solely responsible for cancelling</li>

<p>SOUNDCLOUD deems such Content and/or other data to be</p>
<p>I. misleading, fraudulent, or deceptive; or</p>
<p>II. defamatory, abusive, or obscene; or</p>
<p>III. possibly in violation of a copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right; or</p>

<ol>
<li>SOUNDCLOUD will terminate a user's access to its Services if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is</li>
</ol>
<p>determined to be a repeat infringer. A user is considered a repeat infringer if SOUNDCLOUD receives more</p>
<p>than three (3) legitimate infringement notices for such user’s account or in any other reasonable case.</p>
<p>Grant of License</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD does not have any ownership rights in USER’s Content. After posting your Content on, through or in</p>
<p>connection with the Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the</p>
<p>limited license SOUNDCLOUD requires so that it can perform the Service for its users:</p>
<ol>
<li>By posting Content to the Website, to the extent required to enable the performance of the Services, USER</li>
</ol>

<p>publicly perform, digitally perform, publicly display, and/or otherwise make USER’s Content available to other</p>
<p>users of SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services.</p>
<ol>
<li>This license does not grant SOUNDCLOUD the right to sell USER’s Content or otherwise distribute it outside of</li>
</ol>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD's Website or Services, provided however, that streaming of Content on third party Websites via</p>
<p>embedded widgets or the SOUNCLOUD API or similar tools (“Linked Services”) shall not be deemed a</p>
<p>distribution outside of SOUNDCLOUD’s Website or Service.</p>
<ol>
<li>USER may set further restrictions to the licenses granted under Subsections 1 to 3 of this Section at any time in</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, USER understands and agrees that once Content is distributed to a Linked</p>
