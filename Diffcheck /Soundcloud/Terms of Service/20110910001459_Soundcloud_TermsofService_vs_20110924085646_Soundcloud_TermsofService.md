understood the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines, will abide by them, and that you are either

When we make any updates to these Terms of Use, we will highlight this fact on the Website. In addition, if you


register an account and these Terms of Use are subsequently changed in any material respect (for example, for


security, legal, or regulatory reasons), we will notify you in advance by sending a message to your SoundCloud®


account and an email to the email address that you have provided to us, and the revised Terms of Use will become


effective six (6) weeks after such notification. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any


such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation


section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that six (6) week


period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.


Description of the Platform


The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos,


pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (“**Content**”), which will be stored by SoundCloud


at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other


users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Services and accessible via the Website


and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to


discussions, and enables any user of the Website or certain Services (whether or not registered users of the


Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.


We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, or other services and/or features for the


Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use


that we may release for those specific services or features.


Your SoundCloud Account



You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to certain Services is only available to registered


users.


When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and


password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your


email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our


Privacy Policy.


You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you


will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,


whether or not such activity was authorized by you.


If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized


third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest


possible opportunity.


We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames in appropriate circumstances, as


determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if


activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of


Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable


laws or regulations.


You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section below.


Any attempt to terminate your account by means other than those described in the Termination and Right of


Cancellation section will not be considered a proper termination.


Once your account has been terminated or cancelled, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to


activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be


irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data


or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our


legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account


before terminating or cancelling your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably


deleted following any cancellation of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar


file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This


data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account


is active.

provide USER with certain functionalities and access to, third party websites, databases, networks, servers,


information, software, programs, systems, directories, applications, products or services (hereinafter “External


Websites</span>”).<span style="background-color: green;"> SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">2</span><span style="background-color: green;">Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who


organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any of promotion of these Third Party Competitions</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">If you wish to


participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions


applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility


requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.



Use of </span>S<span style="background-color: green;">oundCloud Player and Widget


The Services include the ability for users to embed the SoundCloud waveform player and a fully customisable player


(“**Widget**”) into other websites, including without limitation, their own website or a third party website or social media


profile, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content


wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters


set by the Uploader.


You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, embed the waveform player or use the Widget in such a


way that you aggregate Content from the Platform (other than Your Content) into a separate destination that replicates


substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a


material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the waveform player or


Widget to embed Content (other than Your Content) into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular


artist or genre, or use the waveform player or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist or other


third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the waveform player or Widget. The foregoing shall apply


whether or not such use is commercial or non-commercial.


SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.


Premium Accounts


Certain features of the Platform are only available to users who register and pay for a premium account. A detailed


description of our premium accounts, including the prices and the features associated with each type of account, is


available here.


Fees for premium accounts are payable at the commencement of the subscription period, and your first payment will


be taken at the time the contract is concluded unless stated otherwise. If you choose any of our monthly accounts,


your account will renew automatically at the end of each monthly period, and payment for the next monthly period will


be taken at that time, unless and until you cancel or terminate your account in the manner described in the


Termination and Right of Cancellation section below. Annual accounts run for twelve months from the date on which


the contract is concluded, and will expire automatically at the end of that twelve month period unless you elect to


renew your subscription. If you renew your annual subscription, payment for the next twelve month period will be taken


at the time you renew.


Payments are due without the need for an invoice, and can be made by Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. All payments


include VAT or other sales tax where applicable. If a credit card processor imposes handling charges in order to


process your payment, we may add such charges to the total amount paid for the service – handling charges are


typically 1% to 3% of the amount to be paid.


If you have a gift code, simply add this in the “Your Promo Code” box during the premium account registration


process. Gift codes should be used within three years. SoundCloud is unable to offer any kind of refund or exchange


for any gift code not redeemed within this period.


</span>O<span style="background-color: green;">nce payment has been made or the gift code accepted, we will send a confirmation email to the email address


provide by you as part of the registration process. </span>U<span style="background-color: red;">N</span><span style="background-color: green;">ntil you receive this confirmation email, no contract is concluded.


Completion of the registration process is merely an offer to conclude a contract, and does not constitute the


conclusion of a contract. The language of the contract is English.


If you wish to upgrade your account, you may do so at any time. If you wish to downgrade your account, you may do so


at the end of your then current subscription period.


Consumers in the European Union have a right to cancel premium accounts for a period of fourteen (14) days after


they are concluded. </span>D<span style="background-color: green;">etails are provided below in the Termination and Right of </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">LOUD does not h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ncellation section.

SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavours to notify registered users of such decision in advance.


You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents,

suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or


access the same from or within any territory or territories.


SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new types of account at


any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its premium accounts from time to time. In


the event of any change(s) to the pricing or features of any premium account to which you have subscribed, such


change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your


subscription. In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of account to which you


subscribe, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed


changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and an email to the then current email address that


we have for your account, at least si</span>x<span style="background-color: red;">ternal</span> <span style="background-color: green;">(6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform


following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination and Right of


Cancellation section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that


six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your account.
