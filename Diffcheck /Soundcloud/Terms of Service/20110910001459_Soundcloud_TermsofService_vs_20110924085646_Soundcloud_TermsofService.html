<p>Description of the Platform</p>
<p>The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos,</p>
<p>pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (“<strong>Content</strong>”), which will be stored by SoundCloud</p>
<p>at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other</p>
<p>users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Services and accessible via the Website</p>
<p>and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to</p>
<p>discussions, and enables any user of the Website or certain Services (whether or not registered users of the</p>
<p>Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, or other services and/or features for the</p>
<p>Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use</p>
<p>that we may release for those specific services or features.</p>
<p>Your SoundCloud Account</p>
<p>You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to certain Services is only available to registered</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p>When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and</p>
<p>password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your</p>
<p>email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our</p>
<p>Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you</p>
<p>will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,</p>
<p>whether or not such activity was authorized by you.</p>
<p>If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized</p>
<p>third parties, you are advised to notify SoundCloud in writing, and should change your password at the earliest</p>
<p>possible opportunity.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames in appropriate circumstances, as</p>
<p>determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if</p>
<p>activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of</p>
<p>Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable</p>
<p>laws or regulations.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination and Right of Cancellation section below.</p>
<p>Any attempt to terminate your account by means other than those described in the Termination and Right of</p>
<p>Cancellation section will not be considered a proper termination.</p>
<p>Once your account has been terminated or cancelled, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to</p>
<p>activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be</p>
<p>irretrievably deleted by SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data</p>
<p>or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our</p>
<p>legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account</p>
<p>before terminating or cancelling your account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably</p>
<p>deleted following any cancellation of your account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar</p>
<p>file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This</p>
<p>data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account</p>
<p>is active.</p>

<p>information, software, programs, systems, directories, applications, products or services (hereinafter “External</p>
<p>Websites</span>”).<span style="background-color: green;"> SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">2</span><span style="background-color: green;">Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who</p>
<p>organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any of promotion of these Third Party Competitions</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">If you wish to</p>
<p>participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions</p>
<p>applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility</p>
<p>requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.</p>
<p>Use of </span>S<span style="background-color: green;">oundCloud Player and Widget</p>
<p>The Services include the ability for users to embed the SoundCloud waveform player and a fully customisable player</p>
<p>(“<strong>Widget</strong>”) into other websites, including without limitation, their own website or a third party website or social media</p>
<p>profile, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content</p>
<p>wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters</p>
<p>set by the Uploader.</p>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, embed the waveform player or use the Widget in such a</p>
<p>way that you aggregate Content from the Platform (other than Your Content) into a separate destination that replicates</p>
<p>substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a</p>
<p>material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the waveform player or</p>
<p>Widget to embed Content (other than Your Content) into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular</p>
<p>artist or genre, or use the waveform player or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist or other</p>
<p>third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the waveform player or Widget. The foregoing shall apply</p>
<p>whether or not such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
<p>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Premium Accounts</p>
<p>Certain features of the Platform are only available to users who register and pay for a premium account. A detailed</p>
<p>description of our premium accounts, including the prices and the features associated with each type of account, is</p>
<p>available here.</p>
<p>Fees for premium accounts are payable at the commencement of the subscription period, and your first payment will</p>
<p>be taken at the time the contract is concluded unless stated otherwise. If you choose any of our monthly accounts,</p>
<p>your account will renew automatically at the end of each monthly period, and payment for the next monthly period will</p>
<p>be taken at that time, unless and until you cancel or terminate your account in the manner described in the</p>
<p>Termination and Right of Cancellation section below. Annual accounts run for twelve months from the date on which</p>
<p>the contract is concluded, and will expire automatically at the end of that twelve month period unless you elect to</p>
<p>renew your subscription. If you renew your annual subscription, payment for the next twelve month period will be taken</p>
<p>at the time you renew.</p>
<p>Payments are due without the need for an invoice, and can be made by Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. All payments</p>
<p>include VAT or other sales tax where applicable. If a credit card processor imposes handling charges in order to</p>
<p>process your payment, we may add such charges to the total amount paid for the service – handling charges are</p>
<p>typically 1% to 3% of the amount to be paid.</p>
<p>If you have a gift code, simply add this in the “Your Promo Code” box during the premium account registration</p>
<p>process. Gift codes should be used within three years. SoundCloud is unable to offer any kind of refund or exchange</p>
<p>for any gift code not redeemed within this period.</p>
<p></span>O<span style="background-color: green;">nce payment has been made or the gift code accepted, we will send a confirmation email to the email address</p>
<p>provide by you as part of the registration process. </span>U<span style="background-color: red;">N</span><span style="background-color: green;">ntil you receive this confirmation email, no contract is concluded.</p>
<p>Completion of the registration process is merely an offer to conclude a contract, and does not constitute the</p>
<p>conclusion of a contract. The language of the contract is English.</p>
<p>If you wish to upgrade your account, you may do so at any time. If you wish to downgrade your account, you may do so</p>
<p>at the end of your then current subscription period.</p>
<p>Consumers in the European Union have a right to cancel premium accounts for a period of fourteen (14) days after</p>
<p>they are concluded. </span>D<span style="background-color: green;">etails are provided below in the Termination and Right of </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">LOUD does not h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ncellation section.</p>
