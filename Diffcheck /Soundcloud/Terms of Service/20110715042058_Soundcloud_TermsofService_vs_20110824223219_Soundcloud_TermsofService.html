<p>Description of Service</p>

<p>User Account</p>
<p>When USER registers for SOUNDCLOUD’s Services, USER may choose a username and password and will receive</p>
<p>a user account from SOUNDCLOUD. The USER is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security</p>
<p>of his/her username, password and account, and shall be responsible for all uses of his/her username and</p>
<p>password, whether or not authorized by USER.</p>
<p>USER shall be liable for all activities and transactions occurring under USER’s account, except for damages caused</p>
<p>by the gross negligent or intentional conduct of SOUNDCLOUD.</p>
<p>USER shall notify SOUNDCLOUD immediately in writing of any unauthorized use of USER’s account including,</p>
<p>without limitation, unauthorized use of USER’s password and/or username, or any other breach of confidentiality or</p>
<p>data security.</p>
<p>It is strictly prohibited to make use of any electronic tools, including spiders, robots (bots), crawlers, data mining tools,</p>
<p>or any other automated means on SOUNDCLOUD’s Website or Services, regardless of the purpose and/or</p>
<p>configuration and/or mode of operation of such electronic tools. This does not include any legitimate means</p>
<p>employed solely for using and connecting the SOUNDCLOUD Application Programming Interface (“API”).</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD may disallow or remove certain usernames and may, with or without prior notice, close USER’s</p>
<p>account if and when activities occur on that account which constitute, at SOUNDCLOUD’s reasonable discretion, a</p>
<p>violation of the present Terms of Use and/or an infringement of other applicable laws and regulations or third party</p>
<p>rights.</p>
<p>USER can cancel his/her account at any time in the profile settings. USER is solely responsible for cancelling his/her</p>
<p>account properly. A telephone request or email from USER to cancel the account will not be considered a proper</p>
<p>cancellation. Upon cancellation of USER’s account, any and all music, videos, photos, pictures, graphics, comments,</p>
<p>communications and other content, data or information of USER will be irretrievably deleted by SOUNDCLOUD, with</p>
<p>the exception of such data SOUNDCLOUD may be obligated to store for a certain period of time in accordance with</p>
<p>applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>SOUNDCLOUD does not claim any ownership rights in any Content and other materials which USER uploads, posts,</p>
<p>stores or exchanges through SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services.</p>

<p>protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other intellectual property rights and laws. USER must</p>
<p>not upload, display, send, transmit or otherwise make available any Content in which USER does not have the</p>
<p>appropriate rights to do so. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, display, public performance or other</p>
<p>unauthorized use of copyrighted works by USER may constitute an infringement of the copyright holders' rights and</p>
<p>may result in civil litigation and criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders;</p>
<p>USER’s Content is an original work by USER and/or USER has all necessary rights, licenses, consents and</p>
<p>permissions to use, and to authorize SOUNDCLOUD to use, any and all copyrights, performance rights or other</p>
<p>intellectual property rights in and to USER’s Content in order to use the Content on SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and</p>
<p>Services;</p>
<p>USER has any and all necessary consent, permission or release of any and all persons identifiable in the Content to</p>
<p>use the name, photo, picture and likeness of those persons on SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services.</p>
<p>No Liability for Content</p>
<p>USER acknowledges that SOUNDCLOUD, by providing the USER with the ability to view and distribute user-</p>
<p>generated Content, is merely acting as a passive conduit (hosting service provider) for the distribution of such</p>
<p>Content, and that SOUNDCLOUD, to the extent permissible by law, does not undertake any obligation or liability</p>
<p>relating to the Content or to the USERS' activities.</p>
<p>USER acknowledges and agrees that SOUNDCLOUD cannot and does not generally review the Content created or</p>
<p>uploaded by USER. USER acknowledges and agrees that SOUNDCLOUD and its respective parents, subsidiaries,</p>
<p>affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders do not undertake or assume</p>
<p>any duty to generally monitor the Website for inappropriate Content.</p>

<p>directors, officers and shareholders assume no responsibility or liability which may arise from the Content of</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services, including, but not limited to, claims for libel, slander, defamation, invasion of</p>
<p>privacy and publicity rights, pornography, obscenity, fraud, or misrepresentation.</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD reserves the right to block, remove or delete any Content, communications, postings, and/or other</p>
<p>data or information if SOUNDCLOUD, in its own sole and unfettered discretion, has reason to believe that such</p>
<p>Content and/or other data or information may infringe the rights of a third party, and in particular if SOUNDCLOUD</p>
<p>deems such Content and/or other data to be</p>
<p>misleading, fraudulent, or deceptive; or</p>
<p>defamatory, abusive, or obscene; or</p>
<p>possibly in violation of a copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right; or</p>
<p>possibly in violation of any applicable law or regulation; or</p>
<p>otherwise unacceptable.</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD will terminate a user's access to its Services if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is</p>
<p>determined to be a repeat infringer. A user is considered a repeat infringer if SOUNDCLOUD receives more than</p>
<p>three (3) legitimate infringement notices for such user’s account or in any other reasonable case.</p>
<p>Grant of License</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD does not have any ownership rights in USER’s Content. After posting your Content on, through or in</p>
<p>connection with the Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the</p>
<p>limited license SOUNDCLOUD requires so that it can perform the Service for its users:</p>
<p>By posting Content to the Website, to the extent required to enable the performance of the Services, USER grants</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD and its successors and assigns and other users of the SOUNDCLOUD Services a limited</p>
<p>worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, license to use, copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly</p>
<p>perform, digitally perform, publicly display, and/or otherwise make USER’s Content available to other users of</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services.</p>
<p>This license does not grant SOUNDCLOUD the right to sell USER’s Content or otherwise distribute it outside of</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD's Website or Services, provided however, that streaming of Content on third party Websites via</p>
<p>embedded widgets or the SOUNDCLOUD API or similar tools (“Linked Services”) shall not be deemed a distribution</p>
<p>outside of SOUNDCLOUD’s Website or Service.</p>
<p>USER may set further restrictions to the licenses granted under Subsections 1 to 3 of this Section at any time in the</p>
<p>track settings, including but not limited to the restriction of the distribution of Content via Linked Services, or by</p>
<p>marking Content “private”.</p>
<p>The license granted under Subsections 1 to 3 will terminate after USER removes the Content from the Website.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, USER understands and agrees that once Content is distributed to a Linked Service,</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD is not obligated to delete or ask other users or a Linked Service to delete that Content, and therefore</p>
<p>that Content may continue to appear and be used indefinitely.</p>
<p>Indemnification</p>
<p>USER agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SOUNDCLOUD, its parent company, successors, assigns,</p>
<p>affiliates, agents, vendors, distributors, licensors, suppliers, other users and their officers, directors and employees</p>

<p>Applicable Law and Jursidiction</p>
<p>The legal relationship between SOUNDCLOUD and USER shall be subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of</p>

<p>of Use; the remainder of the Terms of Use will thus remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement</p>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between SOUNDCLOUD and USER with respect to</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD’s Website and Services, and supersedes any prior agreement between SOUNDCLOUD and USER.</p>
<p>Right of Revocation (German: “Widerrufsrecht”)</p>
<p>If USER is a consumer in the European Union, USER may cancel registration for the free or premium account in text</p>
<p>form (by email, letter or fax) without stating a reason within 14 days of registration. Furthermore, USER may cancel</p>
<p>registration for the premium account in writing (by email, letter or fax) within 14 days without stating a reason, after</p>
<p>changing from a free account to a premium account. The two-week periods begin with the reception of this</p>
<p>information in text form. For exercising this right it is sufficient to send the cancellation of the Agreement to the</p>
<p>following address:</p>
<p>SoundCloud Ltd. </p>
<p>Rosenthaler Straße 13</p>
<p>10119 Berlin</p>
<p>Fax: +49 30 577 098 860</p>
<p>contact@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>In the event of a valid cancellation, both parties shall be obliged to restore any benefits already received in accordance</p>
<p>with legal provisions, and issue any gains (e.g. interest). If USER is unable or partially unable to restore the benefits,</p>
<p>or only able to restore them in poor condition, to SOUNDCLOUD, USER shall be obligated to reimburse</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD for the corresponding value. USER may avoid the duty to reimburse by not using the benefits as his</p>
<p>own and by ceasing to do anything that affects the value of the benefit. Each party must fulfill its obligation for</p>
<p>reimbursement within thirty (30) days. The deadline begins for USER with the sending of the cancellation; for</p>
<p>SOUNDCLOUD with the reception of the cancellation sent by USER. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to revoke</p>
<p>the Agreement expires if both parties fulfilled their contractual obligations upon USER’s explicit consent before USER</p>
<p>exercised the right of revocation.</p>
