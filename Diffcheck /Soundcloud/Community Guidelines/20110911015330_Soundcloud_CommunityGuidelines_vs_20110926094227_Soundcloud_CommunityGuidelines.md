<span style="background-color: green;">Community Guidelines


These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the </span>S<span style="background-color: red;">ig</span><span style="background-color: green;">ou</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">dCloud


community is all about. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud is also subject to our Terms of</span> U<span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">se.</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">E</span><span style="background-color: green;">Do:


Respect others


Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that


everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that


someone is e</span>xp<span style="background-color: red;">lo</span>re<span style="background-color: green;">ss</span><span style="background-color: red;">


Prem</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">um


Ab</span><span style="background-color: green;">ng views </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u</span><span style="background-color: green;">r opinions </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">hat are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our


Terms of</span> Us<span style="background-color: red;">


H</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">, you can </span>l<span style="background-color: red;">p


D</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">t us know by sending an email to support@soundcloud.com.


Create, upload and share


SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the


web. So, be creati</span>ve<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;">lopers


Not</span> <span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">be expressive a</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d let the world know how awesome you are. But remember – only share


sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload


something, check out our Copyright Information pages.


Give us a link


Our widgets enable you to take tracks from</span> SoundCloud<span style="background-color: red;">


y</span><span style="background-color: green;"> and </span>e<span style="background-color: green;">mbed </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">?</span><span style="background-color: green;">hem on other websites. This is really great,


but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so we’d really appreciate it if you could link back to us


whenever you post</span> S<span style="background-color: red;">ign up f</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">und</span><span style="background-color: red;">r free


Tra</span>c<span style="background-color: green;">loud hosted content elsewhere on the web.


Criticize, but do it constructively


Criticism can be really valuable, but only when it’s done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before


posting anything, as</span>k<span style="background-color: red;">s

(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)


The </span>f<span style="background-color: red;">ollowing Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of


SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud


is also subject to our Terms of Use.


Do's


Always be nice


There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that


everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.


Share content that you own the rights to


Always respect the rights holders of a piece of music and never ever share music that you don't own the rights to,


period. If you suspect somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at


copyright@soundcloud.com.


Give us a link


Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.


However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to


us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.


Criticize, but do it constructively


Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your


opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,


unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique,</span> "Would I<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>appreciate receiving the same comment?".


Don't<span style="background-color: red;">s</span>


Upload things that aren't yours to upload


<span style="background-color: green;">Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,


or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks


having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our


Copyright Information pages.


Use someone else’s name


SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the


name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that


someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending


an email to support@soundcloud.com.


Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole


SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a


personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,


racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.


Spam


</span>Th<span style="background-color: red;">is of cours</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;"> m</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">’</span><span style="background-color: red;">an</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">music but </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">lso</span> <span style="background-color: green;">fine line be</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ween promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your message


personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Please do not link to e-commerce or other


similar sites (other than through “buy” links in the player), or use sounds or comments to promote other products


or services. We consider this spam and nobody really likes spam. Comments, messages and forum posts sent


via bots will result in immediate deletion of accounts.


If you break these rules


We take these rules seriously, and </span>ex<span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">ts & imag</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">s </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">hat</span> you <span style="background-color: red;">migh</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o</span> <span style="background-color: red;">h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">s well.

To Sum It Up


**Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we**


**take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe**


**SoundCloud is not the place for you.**


These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.


We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear


that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you


agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us now.


We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often


for any updates.
