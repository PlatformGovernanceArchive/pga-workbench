<p><span style="background-color: green;">Community Guidelines</p>
<p>These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the</p>
<p></span>So<span style="background-color: red;">rr</span><span style="background-color: green;">undCloud communit</span>y<span style="background-color: red;">!</span><span style="background-color: green;"> is all about.

<p><span style="background-color: green;">Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>
<p>everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that</p>
<p>someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending an email.</p>
<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember – only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">f</span> you<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;">netw o</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e unsure whether you can upload</p>

<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Our widgets enable you to take tracks from SoundCloud and embed them on other websites. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so we’d really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but only when it’s done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment</span>?<span style="background-color: green;">".</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">Don't</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. </span>I<span style="background-color: green;">f</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you</span><span style="background-color: red;">need</span> <span style="background-color: red;">h</span><span style="background-color: green;">n</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">ed more information about co</span>p<span style="background-color: green;">yright, check out our</span></p>

<p>Use someone else’s name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings, we <strong>will suspend your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use – including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all</p>
<p>of us to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>
<p>for any updates.</p>
