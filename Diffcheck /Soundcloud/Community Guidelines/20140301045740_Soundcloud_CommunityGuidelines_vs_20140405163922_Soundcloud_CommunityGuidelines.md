Soundclouders are a d</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">verse group wi</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h a lot of diff</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rent opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">S</span><span style="background-color: red;">everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">hose </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">deas are differen</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> to their own.

Bu</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> remember – </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nly</span> <span style="background-color: red;">share


sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload


something, check out our </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">opyright Information pages.


Give us a </span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ink


Our widgets en</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ble you to take track</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> from SoundCloud and embed them on other web</span>si<span style="background-color: red;">tes. This is really great,


but we're pi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">king</span> <span style="background-color: red;">up the bandwidth bill each month, so we’d really appreciate it if you could link back to us


whenever you post </span>Sound<span style="background-color: red;">cloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.


</span>C<span style="background-color: red;">riticize, but do it constructive</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">y


Criticism can be really valuable, but </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nly when it’s done constr</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">ctively. So, please share your opinions, but before


posting anything, ask yourself "Woul</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">Don't


Upload things that aren't yours to upload


Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,


or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks


having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our


Copyright Information pages.


Use someone else’s name


SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the


name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that


someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending


an email.


Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole


SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a


personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,


racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.


Spam


There’s a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and


actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using


sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on


SoundCloud.


If you break these rules


We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive


notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe


that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these


warnings, we **will suspend your account**. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.


Tell us about it


If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.


If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use – including offensive or defamatory


comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can


report this to us by sending an email.


Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all


of us to make sure this happens.

To Sum It Up


**Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we**


**take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe**


**SoundCloud is not the place for you.**


These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.


We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear


that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you


agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.


We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often


for any updates.
