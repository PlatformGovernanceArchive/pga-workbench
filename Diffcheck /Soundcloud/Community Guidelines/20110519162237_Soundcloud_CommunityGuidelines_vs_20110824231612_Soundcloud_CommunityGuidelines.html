<p>(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)</p>
<p>The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of</p>
<p>SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud</p>
<p>is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do's</p>
<p>Always be nice</p>
<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the rights holders of a piece of music and never ever share music that you don't own the rights to,</p>
<p>period. If you suspect somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at</p>
<p>copyright<span style="background-color: red;">s</span>@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.</p>
<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your</p>
<p>opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,</p>
<p>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I</p>
<p>appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don'ts</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>This of course means music but also texts &amp; images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and</p>
<p>sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading OR THEIR AGENT</p>
<p>has given you permission TO share.</p>
<p>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders</p>
<p>Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to</p>
<p>the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to share &amp; receive music, please help us in making</p>
<p>sure it's all legal music.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll, spam or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account</p>
<p>deleted. Please do not link to e-commerce, business and non-music related sites. We consider this spam and</p>
<p>nobody really likes spam.</p>
<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are</strong></p>
<p><strong>appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that</p>
<p>this should be a place of respect between people and responsible content posting. We hope you agree and</p>
<p>understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
