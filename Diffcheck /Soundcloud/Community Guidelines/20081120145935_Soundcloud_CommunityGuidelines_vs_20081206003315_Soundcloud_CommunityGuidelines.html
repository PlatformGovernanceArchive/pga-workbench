<p>(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)</p>
<p>The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of</p>
<p>SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud</p>
<p>is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do's</p>
<p>Always be nice</p>
<p>There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that</p>
<p>everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.</p>
<p>Share content that you own the rights to</p>
<p>Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect</p>
<p>somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at abuse@soundcloud.com</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.</p>
<p>However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to</p>
<p>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Criticize, but do it constructively</p>
<p>Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your</p>
<p>opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,</p>
<p>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I</p>
<p>appreciate receiving the same comment?".</p>
<p>Don'ts</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>This of course means music but also texts &amp; images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and</p>
<p>sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator or the creator of what you're uploading has</p>
<p>given you permission share.</p>
<p>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders</p>
<p>Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to</p>
<p>the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to send &amp; receive music, please help us in making</p>
<p>sure it's all legal music.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account</p>
<p>deleted.</p>
