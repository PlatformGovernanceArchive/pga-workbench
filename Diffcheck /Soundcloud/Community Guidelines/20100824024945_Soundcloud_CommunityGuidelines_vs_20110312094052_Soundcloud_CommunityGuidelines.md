(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)


The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of


SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud


is also subject to our Terms of Use.


Do's


Always be nice


There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that


everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.


Share content that you own the rights to


Always respect the right<span style="background-color: green;">s</span> holders of a piece of music and never ever share <span style="background-color: red;">stolen </span>music<span style="background-color: green;"> that you don't own the rights to</span>,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>period. If you suspect<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

Give us a link


Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.


However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to


us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.


Criticize, but do it constructively


Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your


opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,


unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I


appreciate receiving the same comment?".


Don'ts


Upload things that aren't yours to upload


This of course means music but also texts & images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and


sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading OR THEIR AGENT


has given you permission TO share.


Share music without the consent of the proper right holders


Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to


the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to s<span style="background-color: green;">har</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nd</span> & receive music, please help us in making


sure it's all legal music.


Rant, flame, troll, spam or be an asshole


SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a


personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account


deleted. Please do not link to e-commerce, business and non-music related sites. We consider this spam and


nobody really likes spam.


To Sum It Up


**Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we**


**take other measures and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are**


**appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.**


These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.


We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that


this should be a place of respect between people and responsible content posting. We hope you agree and


understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.
