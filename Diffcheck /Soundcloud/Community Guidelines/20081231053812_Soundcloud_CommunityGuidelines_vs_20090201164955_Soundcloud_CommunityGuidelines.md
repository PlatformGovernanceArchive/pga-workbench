</span>(SoundCloud Community Guidelines)<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>SoundCloud and to ensure that all<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>is also subject to our Terms of Use.


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Do's<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Always be nice<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>everybody should have a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.


<span style="background-color: green;">
**</span>Share content that you own the rights to<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>somebody of breaking the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>rules please report it right away to us at abuse@soundcloud.com


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Give us a link<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>However, we're picking up<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>elsewhere on the web.


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Criticize, but do it constructively<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your<span style="background-color: red;">


opinion</span> <span style="background-color: red;">s</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;"> that good th</span>in<span style="background-color: red;">gs</span><span style="background-color: green;">ion</span> <span style="background-color: green;">so that good things


</span>can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>a second before posting critique, "Would I<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>appreciate receiving the same comment?".


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Don'ts<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Upload things that aren't yours to upload<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


This of course means music but also texts & images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and<span style="background-color: red;">


sharing</span> <span style="background-color: red;">mean</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> you s</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ould</span><span style="background-color: green;">aring</span> <span style="background-color: green;">means you should


</span>always be certain that you are the creator or the creator of what you're uploading has<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>given you permission share.


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Share music without the consent of the proper right holders<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the relevant authorities.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>SoundCloud makes it easy for people to send & receive music, please help us in making<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>sure it's all legal music.


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a<span style="background-color: red;">


personal</span> <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">issu</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> st</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ai</span><span style="background-color: green;">so</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">al</span> <span style="background-color: red;">th</span><span style="background-color: green;">issu</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">strain the


</span>rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>deleted.


<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>To Sum It Up<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">**Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we take other measures**


**and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.**


These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want. We're not trying to set up


rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that this should be a place of respect between people and


responsible content posting. We hope you agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.
