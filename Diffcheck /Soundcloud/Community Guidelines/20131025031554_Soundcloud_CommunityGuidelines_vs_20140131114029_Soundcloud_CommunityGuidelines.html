<p>Soundclouders are a d</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">verse group wi</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h a lot of diff</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rent opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</span></p>

<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload</p>

<p>Our widgets en</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ble you to take track</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> from SoundCloud and embed them on other web</span>si<span style="background-color: red;">tes. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're pi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">king</span> <span style="background-color: red;">up the bandwidth bill each month, so we’d really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post </span>Sound<span style="background-color: red;">cloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p></span>C<span style="background-color: red;">riticize, but do it constructive</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">y</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">nly when it’s done constr</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">ctively. So, please share your opinions, but before</p>
<p>posting anything, ask yourself "Woul</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> I appreciate receiving the same comment?".</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks</p>
<p>having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our</p>
<p>Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someone else’s name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the</p>
<p>name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</p>
<p>There’s a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and</p>
<p>actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive</p>
<p>notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings, we <strong>will suspend your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use – including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all</p>
<p>of us to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>
<p>for any updates.</p>
