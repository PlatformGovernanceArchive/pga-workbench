<p><span style="background-color: red;">C</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">mmunity Guidelines</p>
<p>These Community Guidelines a</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">e designed to ensure that eve</span>ry<span style="background-color: green;">!</span><span style="background-color: red;">one understands what the</p>
<p>SoundCloud community is all about. Don't forget that your use of</span> S<span style="background-color: red;">oundCloud is also subject to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Respect others</p>
<p>Soundclouders are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that</p>
<p>everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that</p>
<p>someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our</p>
<p>Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending an email.</p>
<p>Create, upload and share</p>
<p>SoundCloud enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the</p>
<p>web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember – only share</p>
<p>sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload</p>
<p>s</span>omething<span style="background-color: red;">, check out our Copyright Information pages.</p>
<p>Give us a link</p>
<p>Our</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">idgets enable you to take tracks from SoundCloud and embed them on other websites. This is really great,</p>
<p>but we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month, so we’d really appreciate it if you could link back to us</p>
<p>whenever you post Soundcloud hosted cont</span>ent <span style="background-color: red;">else</span>w<span style="background-color: red;">he</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">e </span>on<span style="background-color: green;">g</span><span style="background-color: red;"> the web.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">I</span><span style="background-color: red;">Criticize, but do it con</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">tructively</p>
<p>Criticism can be really valuable, but only when it’s done constructively. So, please share</span> your <span style="background-color: red;">opi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">etw</span><span style="background-color: red;">ions,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">but bef</span>or<span style="background-color: red;">e</p>
<p>posting anything, as</span>k<span style="background-color: red;"> yourself "Would I appreciate receiving the same</span> co<span style="background-color: red;">mm</span><span style="background-color: green;">nn</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">c</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">?".</p>
<p>Don't</p>
<p>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</p>
<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading,</p>
<p>or have permiss</span>ion <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">unstab le or b </span>ro<span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">w</span> <span style="background-color: red;">all relevant right</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> hold</span>er<span style="background-color: red;">s.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">Any</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ne</span><span style="background-color: green;">utd</span> <span style="background-color: red;">who repe</span>ated<span style="background-color: red;">ly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">?</span><span style="background-color: red;">uploads other people’s content risks</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">I</span><span style="background-color: red;">Copyright</span> <span style="background-color: red;">Information pages.</p>
<p>Use someo</span>ne<span style="background-color: red;"> else’s name</p>
<p>SoundCloud usernames are allocat</span>ed <span style="background-color: red;">on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in t</span>he<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>name of another </span>p<span style="background-color: red;">erson, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that</p>
<p>someone is impersonating you on SoundCloud, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending</p>
<p>an email.</p>
<p>Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole</p>
<p>SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a</p>
<p>personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene,</p>
<p>racist or offensive comments, will put you at risk of having your account suspended or terminated.</p>
<p>Spam</span></p>
<p>T<span style="background-color: red;">he</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">e’s</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make y</span>our m<span style="background-color: red;">essages</span> <span style="background-color: green;">ob</span><span style="background-color: red;">and</p>
<p>act</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ons personal and re</span>le<span style="background-color: red;">vant, the less likely you are to be reported for</span> s<span style="background-color: red;">pam. Faking your own popular</span>it<span style="background-color: red;">y, or using</p>
<p>sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on</p>
<p>SoundCloud.</p>
<p>If you break these rules</p>
<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receiv</span>e</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">T</span><span style="background-color: red;">notification f</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">om a rights holder that an</span>y<span style="background-color: red;"> sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe</p>
<p>that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these</p>
<p>warnings, we <strong>will suspend your account</strong>. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.</p>
<p>Tell us about it</p>
<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it here.</p>
<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or</span> our <span style="background-color: red;">Ter</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">s</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of Use – including offensive or defamatory</p>
<p>comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can</p>
<p>report this to us by sending an email.</p>
<p>Remember, we want SoundCloud to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all</p>
<p>of us to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>To Sum It Up</p>
<p><strong>Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we</strong></p>
<p><strong>take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe</strong></p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud is not the place for you.</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want.</p>
<p>We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear</p>
<p>that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you</p>
<p>agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often</p>
<p>for any updates.</p>
