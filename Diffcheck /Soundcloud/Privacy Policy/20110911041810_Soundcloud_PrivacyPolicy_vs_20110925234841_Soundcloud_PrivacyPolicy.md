Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by


other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public


sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by


a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they


can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments

In


particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your SoundCloud® account to


other social networks, or have elected to have your activity on the Platform published to other networks such as


Facebook. For information on how to control the information that your share, please see the Choice and Control


section below.


Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European


Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have


access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide


their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third


parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised


disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions


and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.


Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the


Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic


Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile


information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to


limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.


As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform


in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third


parties. None of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that


could be used to identify you in real life.


If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or


required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.


To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect


or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or


to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.


In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that


acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the


event of our insolvency.

Choice and Control


We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to


us, and the control you have over that information.


It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information


will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a


SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.


**Email preferences**


Check out the “Email” page within “Settings”. When you are logged in to your account, you can access your Settings at


the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings page.


From the Email page you can tell us:


which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and


any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.

Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as


important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account


and your use of the Platform.


It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)


at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.

before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or


applications.


**Sharing with other users**


SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services


anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings”. By


checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to


this information.


</span>If <span style="background-color: red;">you subscribe to </span>a<span style="background-color: red;"> premium accou</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">y of your sounds con</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ain any personal information</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">we use and retain </span>you<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">can control who has access to these sounds using the


settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your


sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.


**Sharing with app developers**


SoundCloud® has an open A</span>PI<span style="background-color: green;">, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of


the Platform. </span>I<span style="background-color: green;">f</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">pr</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">uld prefer that your sounds are not made a</span>v<span style="background-color: green;">a</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">de you with the
