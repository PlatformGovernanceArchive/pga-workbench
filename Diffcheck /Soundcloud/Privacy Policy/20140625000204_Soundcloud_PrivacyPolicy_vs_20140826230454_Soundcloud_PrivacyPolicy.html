<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>

<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>).</strong> There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal</p>
<p>information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We</p>
<p>will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API: SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when</p>
<p>deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available</p>
<p>over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social</p>
<p>networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or</p>
<p>networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on</p>
<p>SoundCloud® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and</p>
<p>friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full</p>
<p>access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or</p>
<p>repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private</p>
<p>sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect</p>
<p>your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share,</p>
<p>and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other</p>
<p>contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technology</p>
<p>In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the</p>
<p>Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes</p>
<p>information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing</p>
<p>the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as</p>
<p>bug reporting within our mobile apps.</p>
<p>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar</p>
<p>technology. <strong>If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other</strong></p>
<p><strong>technologies as described in our</strong> <strong>Cookies Policy</strong><strong>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal information that</strong></p>
<p><strong>we collect using these technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p>Email preferences</p>
<p>Check out the Email tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can</p>
<p>access your Settings by clicking on your profile picture at the top of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop</p>
<p>down menu.</p>
<p>From the Email tab you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the Account page within your Settings. This will immediately disable all</p>
<p>email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright</p>
<p>infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p>Sharing with other apps and networks</p>
<p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your SoundCloud® account and your</p>
<p>Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds</p>
<p>that you post, listen or favourite on SoundCloud®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account.</p>
<p>Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content</p>
<p>you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile,</p>
<p>make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. <strong>If</strong></p>
<p><strong>you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by</p>
<p>checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box,</p>
<p>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at</p>
<p>http://aboutcookies.org</p>
<p>App preferences</p>
<p>You can use the settings within our iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug</p>
<p>reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the</p>
<p>SoundCloud® tab. With an Android device you need to open the SoundCloud® app and open the basic settings tab</p>
<p>within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting</p>
<p>information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Deleting your account</p>
<p>You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in</p>
<p>mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have</p>
<p>uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are</p>
<p>therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Even if you delete your SoundCloud® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet</p>
<p>search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search</p>
<p>engines' caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any</p>
<p>information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any SoundCloud® Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud® account is</p>
<p>connected, will not delete your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from</p>
<p>the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will</p>
<p>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third</p>
