<span style="background-color: green;">Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your SoundCloud® account to other apps or social


networks such as Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or


networks. In the case of Facebook, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post on SoundCloud® or any


new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks.


In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud®


account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app.


This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. SoundCloud is not


responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or


services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect


your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.

SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.


Email preferences


Check out the “Email” page within “Settings” on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access


your Settings at the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings


page.


From the Email page you can tell us:


which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and


any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.


You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the

Sharing with other networks


The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other

control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.


If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account

shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. 


**If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.**



Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the


activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications


before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or


applications.


Sharing with other users


SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services


anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the


</span>Website. By checking this box,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>access to this information.


If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the


settings in the sound page (click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your


sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.


Sharing with app developers


SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of


the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can


disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the


waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.<span style="background-color: green;"> Please note that your public profile


information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</span>

cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Website without blocking or disabling these technologies,


you consent to our use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of any personal information that we collect using these


technologies.


Deleting your account


You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your


account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data


associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back


up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.


Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you


will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is


connected to your SoundCloud</span> account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>app. You will<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from<span style="background-color: red;">


that</span> th<span style="background-color: green;">at</span><span style="background-color: red;">ird</span> <span style="background-color: green;">third


</span>party app.


Access to your Data


As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


“</span>Settings<span style="background-color: red;">” </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information<span style="background-color: red;">


we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we</span><span style="background-color: red;">hold</span> <span style="background-color: green;">hold


</span>about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please<span style="background-color: red;">


contact</span> <span style="background-color: red;">us</span><span style="background-color: green;">contact</span> <span style="background-color: green;">us


</span>at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.


If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period


of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where


we have a legitimate reason for doing so.


International data transfers


SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance


with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the


United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your


country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in


the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and


must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any


personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to


our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information


as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us
