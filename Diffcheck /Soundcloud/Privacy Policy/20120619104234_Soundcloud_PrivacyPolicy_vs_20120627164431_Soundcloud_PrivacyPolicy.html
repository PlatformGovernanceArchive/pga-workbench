<p>not wish to share your SoundCloud® activity with your Facebook friends, you can control this from the “Settings” page</p>
<p>– for more information, see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:</p>

<p>Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your</p>
<p>website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This</p>
<p>information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API.</p>
<p>Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about yourself.</p>

<p>notifications. For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters,</p>
<p>marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below.</p>
<p>If you are a Facebook user, and one of your Facebook friends registers a SoundCloud® account, we will suggest</p>
<p>to your Facebook friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on SoundCloud.</p>

<p>To operate and maintain your SoundCloud® account, and to provide you with access to the Website and use of</p>
<p>those Services that you may request from time to time.</p>
<p>To identify you as the creator of the sounds that you upload, the comments that you post and/or the other</p>

<p>For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the</p>
<p>proposed use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Sharing of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>We will not share your personal information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong> There</p>
<p>are circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal information we collect about you or which you</p>
<p>provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Other Users: Any personal information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by</p>
<p>other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public</p>
<p>sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by</p>
<p>a premium user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that premium user, so that they</p>
<p>can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments</p>
<p>will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>
<p>With your consent:We will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In</p>
<p>particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your SoundCloud® account to</p>
<p>other social networks, or have elected to have your activity on the Platform published to other networks such as</p>
<p>Facebook. For information on how to control the information that your share, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European</p>
<p>Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have</p>
<p>access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide</p>
<p>their services to us. Where we transfer personal information to these third parties, we ask and require these third</p>
<p>parties to implement appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorised</p>
<p>disclosure of personal information, and only to process personal information in accordance with our instructions</p>
<p>and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.</p>
<p>Users of our API:SoundCloud has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the</p>
<p>Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic</p>
<p>Area. Any personal information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile</p>
<p>information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers over the API. For information on how to</p>
<p>limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform</p>
<p>in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third</p>
<p>parties or make publicly available. None of this information would include any email address or other contact</p>
<p>information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.</p>
<p>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or</p>
<p>required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.</p>
<p>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or</p>
<p>to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud® community.</p>
<p>In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your personal information to any person or company that</p>
<p>acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or on a merger of our business, or in the</p>
<p>event of our insolvency.</p>

<p>website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Please note that Google</p>
<p>only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which</p>

<p>the Choice and Control section below.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, we use the following standard Internet technology in connection with your use of the Platform:</p>
<p>Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed</p>
<p>into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the</p>
<p>content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is</p>
<p>relevant to our users.</p>
<p>Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This</p>
<p>ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. Unlike some other websites, <strong>we do not use Flash</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any</strong></p>
<p><strong>cookies that you might previously have deleted.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which</p>
<p>you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of premium users, to set the widget control colour. If</p>
<p>you access the mobile version of Website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your</p>
<p>user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. <strong>We do not use HTML5 local storage</strong></p>
<p><strong>to collect any personal data or to track your activity on our websites.</strong></p>
<p>For information on your choices regarding cookies and similar technologies, please see the Choice and Control</p>
<p>section below.</p>
<p>Choice and Control</p>
<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of personal information you provide to</p>
<p>us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to visit the Website, although certain information</p>
<p>will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a</p>
<p>SoundCloud® account, you can control your personal information in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>Email preferences</strong></p>
<p>Check out the “Email” page within “Settings” on the Website. When you are logged in to your account, you can access</p>
<p>your Settings at the top left of the screen, and you’ll find the link to the Email page down the right side of the Settings</p>
<p>page.</p>
<p>From the Email page you can tell us:</p>
<p>which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us, and how often; and</p>
<p>any additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you.</p>
<p>You can also turn off email notifications from the “Account” page within your Settings. By clicking on the link on the</p>
<p>Account page, you will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as</p>
<p>important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account</p>
<p>and your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications)</p>
<p>at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other networks</strong></p>
<p>The “Connections” tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other</p>
<p>networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also</p>
<p>control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your SoundCloud® account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for SoundCloud® via your Facebook account, your SoundCloud® account and your Facebook account</p>
<p>will be connected automatically, and information regarding the sounds that you listen to on SoundCloud®, will be</p>
<p>shared with Facebook and will appear in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. <strong>If you do not want this information</strong></p>
<p><strong>shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the</p>
<p>activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications</p>
<p>before sharing your information with, or connecting your SoundCloud® account to, any of these third party sites or</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with other users</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p>Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have</p>
<p>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the “pencil” icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with app developers</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the “pencil” icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer. However, please be</p>
<p>aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Website – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may</p>
<p>not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Platform. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what</p>
<p>cookies have been set and how to reject and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>To opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics on the Website and other websites, please visit</p>

<p>Please Note: We have done our best to provide you with clear and comprehensive information about our use of</p>
<p>cookies and similar technologies. If you choose to use the Website without blocking or disabling these technologies,</p>
<p>you consent to our use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of any personal information that we collect using these</p>
<p>technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting your account</strong></p>
<p>You can delete your account from the “Account” page within your Settings. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your</p>
<p>account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you uploaded and the usage data</p>
<p>associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back</p>
<p>up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>
<p>Please note that deleting any of our applications will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you</p>
<p>will need to do so from within the Account page on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is</p>
<p>connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party</p>
<p>app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from</p>
<p>that third party app.</p>
<p>Access to your Data</p>
<p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the</p>
<p>“Settings” page of your SoundCloud® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information</p>
<p>we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we hold about you, please</p>
<p>contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the address provided below.</p>
<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period</p>
<p>of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where</p>
<p>we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>
<p>International data transfers</p>
<p>SoundCloud is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance</p>
<p>with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the</p>
<p>United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your</p>
<p>country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in</p>
<p>the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and</p>
<p>must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any</p>
<p>personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to</p>
<p>our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information</p>
<p>as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such data, please notify us</p>
<p>immediately at privacy@soundcloud.com.</p>
<p>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out</p>
<p>below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that SoundCloud® users are always aware</p>
<p>of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here</p>
<p>from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by email (to the then current email address provided in their</p>
<p>account), by a notification to their account, and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website.</p>
