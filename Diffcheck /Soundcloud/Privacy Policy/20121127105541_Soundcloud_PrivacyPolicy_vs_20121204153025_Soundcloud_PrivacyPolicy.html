<p>Sharing with other users</p>
<p>SoundCloud® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website and use the Services</p>
<p>anonymously, you can do so by checking the “Anonymous Listening” box in the “Account” tab within “Settings” on the</p>
<p></span>Website. By checking this box,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>access to this information.</p>
<p>If any of your sounds contain any personal information, you can control who has access to these sounds using the</p>
<p>settings in the sound page (click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your</p>
<p>sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.</p>
<p>Sharing with app developers</p>
<p>SoundCloud® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of</p>
<p>the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can</p>
<p>disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the <span style="background-color: red;">“</span>pencil<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> icon in the</p>
<p>waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page.<span style="background-color: green;"> Please note that your public profile</p>
<p>information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that this not publicly available on the Website.</span></p>
