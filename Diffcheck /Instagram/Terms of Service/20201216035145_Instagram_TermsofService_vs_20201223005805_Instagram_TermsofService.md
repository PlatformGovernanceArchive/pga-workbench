Welcome to Instagram! 


These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the


Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use


Instagram, you agree to these terms</span>. 


The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.


These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. 


**ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US**


**WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE**


**YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE**


**ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT**


**OF ARBITRATION BELOW.**


**The Instagram Service**


We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the


Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we


provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you


love. The Service is made up of the following aspects<span style="background-color: green;">:


**Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,**


**discover, and share.**


People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared


experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who


and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,


join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,


features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to


experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.


**Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**


We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help


to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might


need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and


violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We


use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform


secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other


Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.


**Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our**


**growing community.**


Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our


Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies


that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large


scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and


machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.


How can we help?


**Help Center**



Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our


Service.


**Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook**


**Company Products.**


Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,


insights, and information-including the information we have about you</span> (<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">arn more in


the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.


We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you


use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across


the Facebook Company Products.


**Ensuring access to our</span> Service<span style="background-color: green;">.**


To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems


around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this


global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This


infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland


Limited, or their affiliates.


**Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**


We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as


from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that


we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as


all your other experiences on Instagram.


**Research and innovation.**


We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on


research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our


community.


**How Our Service Is Funded**


Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you


acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to


promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such


as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to


you.


We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell


your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the


kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be


interested.


We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them


understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For


example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help


them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies


you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact


you or identifies who you are</span>)<span style="background-color: red;">:

products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner


mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.

**Your Commitments**


In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below

**Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**


We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that


it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community


Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to

or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,


or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably


necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. </span>If you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more


than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the


deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being


undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to


these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us


up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</span>

Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if

**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**


Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO


DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING


THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A


PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible


for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including


unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and


features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our


Service.


Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is


limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't


know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible


("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,


indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these


Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,


information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these


Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past


twelve months.


You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and


against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without


limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way


connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as


required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the


exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and


you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.


**How We Will Handle Disputes.**


Except as provided below, <span style="background-color: green;">**</span>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal<span style="background-color: green;">**</span><span style="background-color: red;"> claim, or</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">**claim, or </span>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">**

<span style="background-color: green;">bring a claim only on your own </span>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Instagram users. If there is a final<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>request for particular relief)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's<span style="background-color: red;"> limitations, then only that</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">limitations, then only that </span>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>All other claims (or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.


Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"


court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims


court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general


jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The


American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>Arbitration Rules. <span style="background-color: green;">**</span>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>


The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:


disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of


our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service


in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to


the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.


This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.


You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these


Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email


address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement


that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:


Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,


CA 94025.


Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written


Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email


address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description


of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.


Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice


of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other


appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after


the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.


We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator


fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you


timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of


arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,


including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.


For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it


will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of


California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to


the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such


claim.


The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with


federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law


provisions.

**Updating These Terms**


We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these


Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required


by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to


these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if


you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want


to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.
