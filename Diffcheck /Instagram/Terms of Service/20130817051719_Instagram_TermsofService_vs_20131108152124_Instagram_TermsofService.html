<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to time. Unless we make a</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You</p>

<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may</li>
</ol>
<p>also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content</p>
<p>that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-</p>
<p>party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or</p>
<p>feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third</p>
<p>party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your</p>
<p>account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram does not control any of these third-party web services or any</p>
<p>of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or</p>
<p>features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY</p>
<p>BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect</p>
<p>the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect</p>
<p>to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the</p>
<p>following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being</p>
<p>shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you,</p>
<p>even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will</p>
<p>hold the Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited</p>
</li>

<p>with Instagram's express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-</li>
</ol>
<p>exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the</p>
<p>Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3</p>
<p>("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who</p>
<p>can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,</p>

<p>service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior</p>

<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be</li>
</ol>
<p>interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of</p>
<p>telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,</p>
<p>without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to</p>
<p>comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to</p>
<p>maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the</p>
<p>Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or</p>
<p>discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security</p>
<p>and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Instagram does not have any</li>
</ol>
<p>obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal</p>
<p>responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that</p>
<p>your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the</p>
<p>general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of</p>
<p>Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have</li>
</ol>
<p>specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings</p>
<p>if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not accept unsolicited</p>
<p>materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us</p>
<p>content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and</p>
<p>services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF</p>
<p>KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>

<p>OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF</p>
<p>OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Instagram's request), indemnify</p>
<p>and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,</p>
<p>trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above</p>
<p>("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard</p>
<p>to your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of</p>
<p>privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of</p>
<p>consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your</p>
<p>local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor</p>
<p>Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate</p>
<p>in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if</p>
<p>Instagram is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then</p>
<p>either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on</p>
<p>the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law</p>
<p>notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration</p>
<p>proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.</p>
<p>You must use this address to opt out:</p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025</p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you</p>
<p>want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then</p>
<p>all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your</p>
<p>relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such</p>
<p>claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any</p>
<p>principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR</p>
<p>THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision</p>
<p>of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with</p>
<p>Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts</p>
<p>located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of</p>
<p>competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability</p>
<p>of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be</p>
<p>construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or</p>
<p>condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not</p>
<p>apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all</p>
<p>of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal</p>
<p>entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any</p>
<p>prior agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations</p>
<p>hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these</p>
<p>Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction</p>
<p>to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use</p>
<p>and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full</p>
<p>force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use</p>
<p>do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
