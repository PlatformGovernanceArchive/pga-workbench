<p>You must not interfere or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, including by transmitting any worms, viruses,</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>Terms of Use or any other Instagram terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your Instagram account. You understand and</li>
</ol>
<p>agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If</p>
<p>you violate the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we can stop</p>
<p>providing all or part of the Service to you.</p>
<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and</li>
</ol>
<p>without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate</p>
<p>your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will</p>
<p>not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service</p>
<p>(e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to time. Unless we make a</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You</p>
<p>agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date</p>
<p>of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as</p>
<p>of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point</p>
<p>forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Instagram is not</li>
</ol>
<p>responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in</p>
<p>disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you</p>
<p>submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may</li>
</ol>
<p>also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that</p>
<p>we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web</p>
<p>site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For</p>
<p>example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which</p>
<p>may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on</p>
<p>the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their</p>
<p>content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or</p>
<p>features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE</p>
<p>SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk,</p>
<p>to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such</p>
<p>Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your</p>
<p>profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed</p>
<p>and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own</p>
<p>option and risk, and you will hold the Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with</p>
<p>Instagram's express consent).</p>
<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-</li>
</ol>
<p>exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the</p>
<p>Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3</p>

<p></span>2. <span style="background-color: green;">Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that</p>
<p>Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode</p>
<p>and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p></span>You <span style="background-color: green;">ack</span><span style="background-color: red;">must </span>no<span style="background-color: red;">t use </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">dge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</p>

<p>rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of</span> U<span style="background-color: green;">se; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate,</p>
<p>misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark</p>
<p>and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you</p>
<p>post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright,</li>
</ol>
<p>trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram</p>
<p>Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices</p>
<p>incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,</p>
<p>perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior</li>
</ol>
<p>written permission of Instagram, except in accordance with our brand guidelines, available here:</p>
<p>http://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/182487. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are</p>
<p>service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior</p>
<p>written permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be</li>
</ol>
<p>interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of</p>
<p>telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,</p>
<p>without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to</p>
<p>comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to</p>
<p>maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the</p>
<p>Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or</p>
<p>discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security</p>
<p>and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Instagram does not have any</li>
</ol>
<p>obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal</p>
<p>responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and</li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>

<p>Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality,</p>
<p>property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-</p>
<p>governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by</p>
<p>you</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,</p>
<p>trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above</p>
<p>("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to</p>
<p>your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of</p>
<p>privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of</p>
<p>consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local</p>
<p>"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Instagram will</p>
<p>participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought</p>
<p>in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the</p>
<p>proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is</p>
<p>unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have</p>
<p>the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be</p>
<p>entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award</p>
<p>damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration</p>
<p>proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.</p>
<p>You must use this address to opt out:</p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025</p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you want to</p>
<p>opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of</p>
<p>the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship</p>
<p>with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such claim</p>
<p>arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of</p>
<p>conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS</p>
<p>FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the</p>
<p>arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute</p>
<p>you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent</p>
<p>jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any</p>
<p>remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a</p>
<p>waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any</p>
<p>other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes</p>
<p>arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions</p>
<p>with Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior</p>
<p>agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole</p>
<p>or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported assignment or delegation by</p>
<p>you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights</p>
<p>hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise</p>
<p>unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity</p>
<p>and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course</p>
<p>of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party</p>
<p>beneficiary rights.</p>
<p><strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where</p>
<p>such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such</p>
<p>jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or</p>
<p>jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that</p>
<p>Instagram provides.</p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be</p>
<p>downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or</p>
<p>(b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny</p>
<p>Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a</p>
<p>national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Instagram Services contain Content of Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright, trademark,</li>

<p>Instagram hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Instagram Content</p>

<p>Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications</p>
<p>links and equipment that are beyond the control of Instagram. Also, although Instagram will normally only delete Content that violates</p>
<p>this Agreement, Instagram reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be</p>
<p>stored by Instagram in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently,</p>
<p>Instagram encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service.</p>
<p>Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Instagram Services, or the loss of any</p>
