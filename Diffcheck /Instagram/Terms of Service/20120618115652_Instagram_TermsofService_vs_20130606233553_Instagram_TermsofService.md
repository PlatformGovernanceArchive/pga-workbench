14. You must comply with Instagram's Community Guidelines, available here: http://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/262387-

community-guidelines.

15. You must not create accounts with the Service through unauthorized means, including but not limited to, by using an automated device,

16. You must not attempt to restrict another user from using or enjoying the Service and you must not encourage or facilitate violations of these

Terms of Use or any other Instagram terms.

17. Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your Instagram account. You understand and

agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If

you violate the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we can stop

providing all or part of the Service to you.

**General Conditions**

1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and

without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:

https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate

your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will

not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service

(e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).

2. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.

3. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (**"Updated Terms"**) from time to time. Unless we make a

change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You

agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date

of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.

Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as

of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point

forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.

4. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.

5. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.

6. We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our

sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.

7. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Instagram is not

responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in

disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you

submit or post Content or any personal or other information.

8. There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may

also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that

we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web

site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For

example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which

may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on

the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their

content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or

features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE

SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk,

to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such

Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you

acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your

profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed

and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own

option and risk, and you will hold the Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.

9. You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.

10. We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to,

user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with

Instagram's express consent).

**Rights**

1. Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-

exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the

Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3

</span>("S<span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ring of Your Infor</span>m<span style="background-color: green;">ation"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information</span>").<span style="background-color: green;"> You can choose</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">1</span><span style="background-color: green;">who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.

</span>2. <span style="background-color: green;">Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that

Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode

and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.

3. </span>You <span style="background-color: green;">ack</span><span style="background-color: red;">must </span>no<span style="background-color: red;">t use </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">dge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.

4. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted </span>b<span style="background-color: green;">y you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the

rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of</span> U<span style="background-color: green;">se; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate,

misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark

and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you

post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.

5. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright,

trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram

Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices

incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,

perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.

6. The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior

written permission of Instagram, except in accordance with our brand guidelines, available here:

http://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/182487. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are

service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior

written permission from Instagram.

7. Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be

interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of

telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,

without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to

comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to

maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the

Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or

discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security

and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.

8. You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Instagram does not have any

obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal

responsibility for that Content.

9. Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and

Instagram, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You

acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that

your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the

general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of

Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.

10. It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have

specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if

your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not accept unsolicited

materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us

content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,

ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and

services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OF GOD,

PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT

YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT OF INSTAGRAM'S

YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR

OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO

ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR

EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY

THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES.

BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS

THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF

SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH

PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT

KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM

MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND

YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES,

KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY

SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

**Indemnification**

You (and also any third party for</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">it</span>ho<span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">ut</span> <span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">pri</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u ope</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Instagram's request), indemnify and

hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>it<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">ten c</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">nsen</span>t <span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">from Instagram, </span>i<span style="background-color: green;">mitatio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">, reasonable

attorney's fees and </span>c<span style="background-color: green;">osts, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the

Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these

Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality,

property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-

governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by

you</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of

Instagram.

**Arbitration**

Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,

trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above

("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to

your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of

privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of

consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local

"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Instagram will

participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought

in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the

proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is

unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have

the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be

entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award

damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.

You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration

proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.

You must use this address to opt out:

Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025

You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that you want to

opt out of this arbitration agreement.

If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of

the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship

with Instagram.

**Time Limitation on Claims**

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such claim

arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.

**Governing Law & Venue**

These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of

conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS

FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the

arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute

you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the

courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent

jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any

remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a

waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any

other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes

arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions

with Instagram.

**Entire Agreement**

If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior

agreements between you and Instagram. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole

or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported assignment or delegation by

you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights

hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise

unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity

and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course

of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party

beneficiary rights.

**Territorial Restrictions**

The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where

such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such

jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or

jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that

Instagram provides.

Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be

downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or

(b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny

Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a

national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.

The effective date of these Terms of Use is January 19, 20</span>13. <span style="background-color: green;">The</span><span style="background-color: red;">You mu</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">e</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Te</span><span style="background-color: red;">not t</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ans</span>m<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">it</span> <span style="background-color: red;">any</span><span style="background-color: green;">of Use</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">orms or virus</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s o</span>r<span style="background-color: red;"> any cod</span>e <span style="background-color: red;">of a destructive nature.

<span style="background-color: red;">15</span><span style="background-color: green;">version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English version controls</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">

A</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Violation of any of these agreements will result in the termination of your Instagram account.

<span style="background-color: red;">2. We reserve the right to alter these </span>Terms<span style="background-color: red;"> of Use at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, we</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">will notify you via internet mail according to the preference expressed on your account. What constitutes a "material change" will be

determined at our sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgement.

3. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

4. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username that becomes inactive, violates trademark, or may mislead other users.

usernames.

**Proprietary Rights in Content on Instagram**

1. Instagram does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship,

applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Instagram Services. By displaying or

publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Instagram Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid

and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and

translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media

channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.

2. Some of the Instagram Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you

hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction

with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to

you.

3. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Instagram Services or otherwise have the

right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Instagram Services does

not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person,

and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to

pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Instagram

Services.

4. The Instagram Services contain Content of Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright, trademark,

patent, trade secret and other laws, and Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Instagram Services.

Instagram hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Instagram Content

(excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Instagram Services.

5. The Instagram Services contain Content of Users and other Instagram licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may

Instagram Services.

6. Instagram performs technical functions necessary to offer the Instagram Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or

reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Instagram Services.

7. Although the Site and other Instagram Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or other Instagram

Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications

links and equipment that are beyond the control of Instagram. Also, although Instagram will normally only delete Content that violates

this Agreement, Instagram reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be

stored by Instagram in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently,

Instagram encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service.

Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Instagram Services, or the loss of any

Content.
