<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use</p>
<p>Instagram, you agree to these terms</span>. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects<span style="background-color: green;">:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>

<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you</span> (<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">arn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our</span> Service<span style="background-color: green;">.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such</p>
<p>as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are</span>)<span style="background-color: red;">:</p>

<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">limitations, then only that </span>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>All other claims (or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
