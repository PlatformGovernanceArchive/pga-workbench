**The Instagram Service**


We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the


Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we


provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you


love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):


**Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,**


**discover, and share.**


People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared


experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who


and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,


join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,


features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to


experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.


**Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**


We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help


to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might


need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and


violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We


use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform


secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other


Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.


**Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our**


**growing community.**


Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our


Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies


that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large


scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and


machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.


Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our

**Your Commitments**


In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below


commitments to us.


**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,


but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to


commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.


You must be at least 13 years old.


You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable


laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied


party listing.


We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our


policies.


You must not be a convicted sex offender.


**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad


community requires that we all do our part.


**You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**


You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with


accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you


may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for


someone else unless you have their express permission.


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>**You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or**


**unauthorized purpose.**<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


**You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our**


**policies, including in particular the** **Instagram Community Guidelines****,**


**Instagram Platform Policy****, and** **Music Guidelines****.** Learn how to report conduct or


content in our Help Center.


**You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the**


**Service.**


**You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in**


**unauthorized ways.**


This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without


our express permission.


**You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account**


**(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or**


**badges of other users.**


**You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates**


**someone else's rights, including intellectual property.**


Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual


property rights, here.


**You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior**


**written consent.**


**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions


that we need to provide the Service.


**We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use**


**it.**


Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of


your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or


upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on


or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,


transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,


copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your


content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this


license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to


appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about


how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data


Policy and visit the Instagram Help Center.


**Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your**


**relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**


You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about


your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection


with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage


with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For


example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has


paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows


of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts


can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We


will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.


**You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your**


**device.**


**Additional Rights We Retain**


If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we


believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's


intellectual property or impersonates another user).


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make


available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not


yours).


You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as


expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.


You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to


modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source


code from us.


**Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**


We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that


it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community


Guidelines), or we are <span style="background-color: green;">permitted or </span>required to do so by law. We can refuse to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>provide or stop<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or<span style="background-color: red;"> disabling your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">disabling your </span>account) immediately <span style="background-color: red;">if you: clearly, seriously or repea</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">edly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">protect our community or ser</span>vi<span style="background-color: green;">ces, or if you


create risk or legal exposure for us, vi</span>olate these Terms of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Use<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> o<span style="background-color: red;">u</span>r <span style="background-color: red;">p</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ur</span><span style="background-color: red;">licies</span> <span style="background-color: green;">policies


</span>(including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly<span style="background-color: red;">


infringe</span> <span style="background-color: green;">inf</span><span style="background-color: red;">othe</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">inge</span> <span style="background-color: green;">other


</span>people's intellectual property rights, or where we are <span style="background-color: green;">permitted or </span>required to do so


by law<span style="background-color: red;">. If we take action to remove your content for violating our Community


Guidelines, or disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where


appropriate</span>. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to


disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center.


Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will


still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below


called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after


your account is terminated or deleted.


**Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**


**Our Agreement.**


Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your


use of our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or


related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms


that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment


features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those


terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.


If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.


Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If


we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.


We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.


**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**


This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.


You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our


consent.


Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if


our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.


**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**


<span style="background-color: green;">Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or

Service.


Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is


limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't

Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,


information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these


Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past


twelve months.


You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and

Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or

Class actions and


class arbitrations ar</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own


behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final


judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)


cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that


claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or


requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.


Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"


court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims


court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general


jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The


American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer


Arbitration</span> R<span style="background-color: red;">ep</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">b</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ic</span><span style="background-color: green;">es.</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u and we expressly waive a trial by jury.


The </span>f<span style="background-color: green;">ollowing claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:

our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service
