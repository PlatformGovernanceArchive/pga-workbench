<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p></span>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure</p>
<p>may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their</p>
<p>affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old<span style="background-color: red;"> or the minimum legal age in your country to use</p>
<p>Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you</p>
<p>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for</p>
<p>someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>

<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>

<p>class arbitrations ar</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)</p>
<p>cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that</p>
<p>claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or</p>
<p>requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration.</span> T<span style="background-color: green;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
