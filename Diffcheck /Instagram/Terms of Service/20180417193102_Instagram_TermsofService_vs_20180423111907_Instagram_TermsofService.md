encourage or facilitate violations of these Terms of Use or any other Instagram terms.


17. Violation of these Terms of Use may, in Instagram's sole discretion, result in termination of your


Instagram account. You understand and agree that Instagram cannot and will not be responsible for


the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter


or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we


can stop providing all or part of the Service to you.


**General Conditions**


1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,


without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account


by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to


the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,


likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users


will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data


may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).


2. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will


immediately cease.


3. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (**"Updated Terms"**) from


time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide


reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may


notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service


after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may


reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review


these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be


effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and


will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any


disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.


4. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.


5. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.

other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,


including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.


8. There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-


party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or


comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,


maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service


and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile


on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature


that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be


publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires


you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram


does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly


acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party


services or features.</span> YOU<span style="background-color: red;">R</span> C<span style="background-color: red;">ORRESPONDENCE </span>AN<span style="background-color: red;">D</span> <span style="background-color: green;">OP</span><span style="background-color: red;">BUSINESS DEALINGS WI</span>T<span style="background-color: red;">H</span> <span style="background-color: red;">THIRD

connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")

Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you


use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the


Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to


be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such


information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the


Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.


9. You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.

result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's


express consent).


**Rights**


1. Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,


you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-


licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to


the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not


limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5


("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,



including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.


2. Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and


promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the


Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such


advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.


3. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial


communications as such.


4. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or


otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the


posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or


infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,


copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,


fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)


you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.


5. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram


Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between


you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.


You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary


rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,


modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,


broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.


6. The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or


used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance


with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page


headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade


dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written


permission from Instagram.


7. Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be


occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled


maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links


and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any


reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by


Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not


be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your


own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that


you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be


liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any


Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that


the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.


8. You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the


Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.


If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.


9. Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at


http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-


confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You


acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other


type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram


in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including


with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on


the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you


provide.


10. It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other


materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,


conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are


similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does


not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so


transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,


or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,


ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,


developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.


**Reporting Copyright and Other IP Violations**


1. We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.


2. We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more about


how to report claims of intellectual property infringement, visit here.


3. If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account


when appropriate.

The</span> I<span style="background-color: green;">nstagram Service


We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the


Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we


provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you


love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):


**Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,**


**discover, and share.**


People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared


experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand


who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you


create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is


highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,


and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and


others do on and off Instagram.


**Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**


We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that


help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think


How can we help?


**Help Center**



they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat


abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and


deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your


information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information


about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law


enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.


**Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our**


**growing community.**


Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our


Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge


technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an


incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial


intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex


processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the


functionality and integrity of our Service.


**Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook**


**Company Products.**


Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,


systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you


(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,


safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook


Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless


and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.


**Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**


To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our


systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This


infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland


Limited, or their affiliates.


**Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care**


**about.**


We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well


as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored


content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that


content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.


**Research and innovation.**


We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with


others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being


of our community.


The Data Policy


Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy


explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also


explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy


and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.


Your Commitments


In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below


commitments to us. 


**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,


but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to


commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. 


You must be at least 13 years old.



You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under


applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an


applicable denied party listing.


We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of


our policies.


You must not be a convicted sex offender.


**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad


community requires that we all do our part.


**You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**


You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us


with accurate and up to date information (including registration information).


Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an


account for someone else unless you have their express permission.


**You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal**


**or unauthorized purpose.**


**You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or**


**our policies, including in particular the** **Instagram Community**


**Guidelines****,** **Instagram Platform Policy****, and** **Music Guidelines****.** Learn how


to report conduct or content in our Help Center.


**You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation**


**of the Service.**


**You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in**


**unauthorized ways.**


This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way


without our express permission.


**You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account**


**(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or**


**badges of other users.**


**You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that**


**violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property.**


Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your


intellectual property rights, here.


**You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our**


**prior written consent.**


**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions


that we need to provide the Service. 


**We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license**


**to use it.**


</span>N<span style="background-color: green;">othing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim


ownership of your content that you post on or through the </span>S<span style="background-color: green;">ervice. Instead, when


you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights


(like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to


us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license


to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate,


and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and


application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content


or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others


and they have not deleted it. </span>T<span style="background-color: green;">o learn more about how we use information, and


how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the


Instagram Help Center.



**Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about**


**your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored**


**content.**


You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information


about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in


connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you


follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any


compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored


post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. </span>A<span style="background-color: green;">s with


actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored


content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who


have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad


settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.


**You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on**


**your device.**


Additional Rights We Retain


If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it


if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes


someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).


If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make


available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we


provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our


content (but not yours).


You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as


expressly permitted by our Brand </span>G<span style="background-color: green;">uidelines or with our prior written


permission.


You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to


modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract


source code from us.


Content </span>R<span style="background-color: green;">emoval and Disabling or


Terminating Your </span>A<span style="background-color: green;">ccount


We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we


believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram


Community Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We


can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including


terminating or disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or


services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of


Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you


repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are


permitted or required to do so by law. If you believe your account has been


terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account,


consult our Help Center.


Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies


and will still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the


section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will


still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.



Our Agreement and What Happens if


We Disagree


**Our Agreement.**


Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our </span>M<span style="background-color: green;">usic Guidelines, and your use of


our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related


services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will


also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will


be asked to agree to the</span> C<span style="background-color: green;">ommunity Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with


this agreement, those other terms will govern.


If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.


Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail


to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.


We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.


**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**


This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.


You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.


</span>O<span style="background-color: red;">NTENT</span><span style="background-color: green;">ur rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> this could occur if our

WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION TO INSTAGRAM OR VIA THE SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE


INSTAGRAM PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,</span> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING<span style="background-color: red;">, BUT


NOT LIMITED TO,</span> THE<span style="background-color: green;">


IMPLIED</span> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>PURPOSE,<span style="background-color: red;">


</span><span style="background-color: green;"> TITLE, AND </span>NON-INFRINGEMENT<span style="background-color: green;">.


We also don’t control what people and others do or say</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> and we aren’t responsible for


their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful


or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by


other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.


Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is


limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know


what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable")


for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect,


exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</span> T<span style="background-color: green;">erms, even


if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or


account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed


the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.


You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against


any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,


reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these


Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of


any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any


matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim


without our prior written consent.


**How We Will Handle Disputes.**


Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or


dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or </span>I<span style="background-color: green;">nstagram


("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and


class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own


behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final


judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be


arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that


request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain


subject to this provision.



Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,


if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if


you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the


claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. </span>T<span style="background-color: red;">LE,</span><span style="background-color: green;">he American Arbitration


Association will administer all arbitrations under its</span> C<span style="background-color: green;">onsumer Arbitration Rules. You and


we expressly waive a trial by jury. 


The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes


related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform


Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized


ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and


enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. 


This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. 


You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these


Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email


address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that


you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:


Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park, CA


94025.


Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of


Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone


number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the


relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Facebook, Inc.,


ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we


commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use


with your Instagram account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a


dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may


commence arbitration.


We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees


for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely


provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of


arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including


rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.


For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will


be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a


state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal


jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.


The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with


federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law


provisions.


**Unsolicited Material.**


We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any


restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep


them confidential.


Updating These Terms


We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these


Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required


by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to


these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if


you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want


to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.

BY THE INSTAGRAM PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE


DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY


WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE


INSTAGRAM PARTIES. 


BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH


RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE


WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY


EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY


SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL


RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO


EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST


HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." 


INSTAGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD


PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM



ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY


CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.


**Indemnification**


You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at


Instagram's request), indemnify and hold the Instagram Parties harmless from and against any claims,


liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs,


arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on


the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii)


your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without


limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of


any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-


governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;


or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Instagram in the defense of


any claim. Instagram reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to


indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of


Instagram.


**Arbitration**


Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as


trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API


Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that


all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your


relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the


Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the


American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram


hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims"


court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither


you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this


agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative


capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.


This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American


Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of


filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the


Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered


in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will


not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. 


You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to


participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the


date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: 


Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 


You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,


and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. 


If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is


found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.


This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.


**Time Limitation on Claims**


You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be


filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.


**Governing Law & Venue**


These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,


without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY


THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF


OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these


Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any


dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to


submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all


such disputes. 


If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during


arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these


Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to


insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of


any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such


term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution


provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.


This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.



**Entire Agreement**


If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an


agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and


Instagram and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Instagram.


You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in


part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported


assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.


Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of


these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the


parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not


affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of


Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act


to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.


**Territorial Restrictions**


The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in


any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would


subject Instagram to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to


limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,


at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or


other feature that Instagram provides. 


Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no


software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of)


any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury


Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders.


By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in,


under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. 


The effective date of these Terms of Use is January 19, 2013. These Terms of Use were written in English (US).


To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English


version controls.
