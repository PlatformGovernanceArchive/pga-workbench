<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>General Conditions<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here:</p>
<p>https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/. If we terminate your access to the Service or you</p>
<p>use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships,</p>
<p>and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to</p>
<p>navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and</p>
<p>appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately</li>
</ol>
<p>cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>

<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD</p>
<p>PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that</p>
<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>
<p>information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the</p>
<p>Instagram Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the</p>
<p>result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Instagram's</p>
<p>express consent).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Rights<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>

<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>

<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>

</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not</p>
<p>accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>

<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the</p>
<p>date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>
<p>Instagram, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025 </p>
<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Instagram account,</p>
<p>and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. </p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is</p>
<p>found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Time Limitation on Claims<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be</p>
<p>filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Governing Law &amp; Venue<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,</p>
<p>without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY</p>
<p>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF</p>
<p>OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these</p>
<p>Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any</p>
<p>dispute you have with Instagram exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to</p>
<p>submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all</p>
<p>such disputes. </p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during</p>
<p>arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these</p>
<p>Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to</p>
<p>insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of</p>
<p>any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such</p>
<p>term or condition or any other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution</p>
<p>provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong></span>Entire Agreement<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span></p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an</p>
<p>agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and</p>

<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
