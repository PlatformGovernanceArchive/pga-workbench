The Instagram Service


We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the


Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we


provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you


love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):


**Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,**


**discover, and share.**


People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared


experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand


who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you


create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is


highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,


and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and


others do on and off Instagram.


**Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**


We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that


help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think


<span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?


**Help Center**



</span>they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat


abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and


deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your


information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information


about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law<span style="background-color: red;">


How can we help?


**Help Center**


To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies. By clicking or navigating the site, you agree to allow our collection of


information on and off Facebook through cookies. Learn more, including about available controls: Cookies Policy.

enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.


**Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our**


**growing community.**


Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our


Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge


technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an


incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial


intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex


processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the


functionality and integrity of our Service.


**Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook**


**Company Products.**


Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,


systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you


(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,


safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook


Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless


and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.


**Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**


To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our


systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This


infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland


Limited, or their affiliates.


**Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care**


**about.**


We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well


as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored


content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that


content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.


**Research and innovation.**


We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with


others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being


of our community.


The Data Policy


Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy


explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also


explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy


and Security Settings.<span style="background-color: green;"> You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</span>


Your Commitments


In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below


commitments to us. 


**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,


but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to


commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. 


You must be at least 13 years old.


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under


applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an


applicable denied party listing.


We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of


our policies.<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


You must not be a convicted sex offender.


**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad


community requires that we all do our part.


**You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**


You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us


with accurate and up to date information (including registration information).


Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an


account for someone else unless you have their express permission.


**You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal**


**or unauthorized purpose.**


**You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or**


**our policies, including in particular the** **Instagram Community**


**Guidelines****,** **Instagram Platform Policy****, and** **Music Guidelines****.** Learn how


to report conduct or content in our Help Center.


**You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation**


**of the Service.**


**You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in**


**unauthorized ways.**


This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way


without our express permission.


**You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account**


**(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or**


**badges of other users.**


**You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that**


**violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property.**


Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your


intellectual property rights, here.


**You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our**


**prior written consent.**


**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions


that we need to provide the Service. 


**We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license**


**to use it.**


Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim


ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when


you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights


(like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to


us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license


to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate,


and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and


application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content


or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others


and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and


how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the


Instagram Help Center.


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>**Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about**


**your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored**


**content.**


You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information


about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in


connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any


compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored


post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with


actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored


content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who


have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad


settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.


**You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on**


**your device.**


Additional Rights We Retain


If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it


if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes


someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).


If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make


available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we


provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our


content (but not yours).


You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as


expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written


permission.


You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to


modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract


source code from us.


Content Removal and Disabling or


Terminating Your Account


We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we


believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram


Community Guidelines), or we are <span style="background-color: green;">permitted or </span>required to do so by law. We<span style="background-color: red;"> can refuse to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">can refuse to </span>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including<span style="background-color: red;"> terminating</span>

still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.

We Disagree


**Our Agreement.**<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of


our API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related


services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will


also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will


be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with


this agreement, those other terms will govern.


If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.


Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail


to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.


We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.


**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**


This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.


You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.


Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our


ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

**How We Will Handle Disputes.**


If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the

if we know they are possi</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">. This includes when we delete you</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> content, information, or


account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed


the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.


You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against


any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,

Class actions and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own


behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final


judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be


arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that


request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain


subject to this provision.



Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,


if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if


you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the


claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration


Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration </span>R<span style="background-color: red;">ep</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">les. You and


we expressly waive a trial </span>b<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">lic</span> <span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">jury. 


The </span>f<span style="background-color: green;">ollowing claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes


related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform


Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized
