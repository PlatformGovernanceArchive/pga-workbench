<p>the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the letter</p>
<p>or spirit of these Terms of Use, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Instagram, we</p>
<p>can stop providing all or part of the Service to you.</p>
<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason,</li>
</ol>
<p>without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Instagram account</p>
<p>by logging into the Service and completing the form available here. If we terminate your access to</p>
<p>the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,</p>
<p>likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users</p>
<p>will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data</p>
<p>may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will</li>
</ol>
<p>immediately cease.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from</li>
</ol>
<p>time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide</p>
<p>reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may</p>
<p>notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service</p>
<p>after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may</p>
<p>reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be</p>
<p>effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and</p>
<p>will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any</p>
<p>disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or</li>
</ol>
<p>offline. You agree that Instagram is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Instagram</p>
<p>reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and</p>
<p>other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,</p>
<p>including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</p>
<ol>
<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-</li>
</ol>
<p>party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or</p>
<p>comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control,</p>
<p>maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service</p>
<p>and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile</p>
<p>on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature</p>
<p>that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be</p>
<p>publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires</p>
<p>you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Instagram</p>
<p>does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that Instagram is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party</p>
<p>services or features.</span> YOU<span style="background-color: red;">R</span> C<span style="background-color: red;">ORRESPONDENCE </span>AN<span style="background-color: red;">D</span> <span style="background-color: green;">OP</span><span style="background-color: red;">BUSINESS DEALINGS WI</span>T<span style="background-color: red;">H</span> <span style="background-color: red;">THIRD</p>

<p>connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application")</p>
<p>and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your</p>
<p>Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you</p>
<p>use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the</p>
<p>Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to</p>
<p>be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Instagram has not itself provided such</p>

<p><strong>Rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead,</li>
</ol>
<p>you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-</p>
<p>licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to</p>
<p>the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not</p>
<p>limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5</p>
<p>("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities,</p>
<p>including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and</li>
</ol>
<p>promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the</p>
<p>Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such</p>
<p>advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial</li>
</ol>
<p>communications as such.</p>
<ol>
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the</p>

<p>infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights,</p>
<p>copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties,</p>
<p>fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv)</p>
<p>you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram</li>
</ol>
<p>Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between</p>
<p>you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Service.</p>
<p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary</p>
<p>rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce,</p>
<p>modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,</p>
<p>broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or</li>
</ol>
<p>used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Instagram, except in accordance</p>
<p>with our brand guidelines, available here: https://www.instagram-brand.com/. In addition, all page</p>
<p>headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade</p>
<p>dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written</p>
<p>permission from Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be</li>
</ol>
<p>occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled</p>
<p>maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links</p>
<p>and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any</p>
<p>reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by</p>
<p>Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not</p>
<p>be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your</p>
<p>own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that</p>
<p>you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be</p>
<p>liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any</p>
<p>Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that</p>
<p>the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You agree that Instagram is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the</li>
</ol>
<p>Service. Instagram does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content.</p>
<p>If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at</li>
</ol>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and Instagram, any Content will be non-</p>
<p>confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You</p>
<p>acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other</p>
<p>type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram</p>
<p>in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including</p>
<p>with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on</p>
<p>the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you</p>
<p>provide.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other</li>
</ol>
<p>materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,</p>
<p>conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are</p>
<p>similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does</p>
<p>not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so</p>
<p>transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions,</p>
<p>or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,</p>
<p>ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation,</p>
<p>developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

<p>The</span> I<span style="background-color: green;">nstagram Service</p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>
<p>deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your</p>
<p>information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information</p>
<p>about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law</p>
<p>enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,</p>
<p>safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>

<p>matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim</p>

<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>
<p>Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized</p>
<p>ways (for example, automated ways</span>). <span style="background-color: green;">In addition, issues relating to the scope and</p>
<p>enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. </span></p>
<p>Y<span style="background-color: red;">OU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT</p>
<p>OF INSTAGRAM'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT</p>

<p>court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither</p>
<p>you nor Instagram will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this</p>
<p>agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative</p>
<p>capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Instagram is a party to the proceeding.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American</p>
<p>Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of</p>
<p>filing the case, then either Instagram or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the</p>
<p>Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered</p>
<p>in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will</p>
<p>not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to</p>
<p>participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing</span> within 30 days of the<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>date</span> <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">th</span>at<span style="background-color: red;"> you first b</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">came</span> <span style="background-color: red;">subjec</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> to t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">is </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">rbi</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ration</span> <span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">pr</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">visi</span><span style="background-color: green;">u agreed t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;"> these</p>

<p>You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported</p>
<p>assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void.</p>
<p>Instagram may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the</p>
<p>parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not</p>
<p>affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of</p>
<p>Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act</p>
<p>to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction,</p>
<p>at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or</p>
