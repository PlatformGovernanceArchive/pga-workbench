<p>The Instagram Service</p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand</p>
<p>who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you</p>
<p>create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is</p>
<p>highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,</p>
<p>and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and</p>
<p>others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that</p>
<p>help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat</p>
<p>abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and</p>
<p>deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your</p>
<p>information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information</p>

<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge</p>
<p>technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an</p>
<p>incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex</p>
<p>processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the</p>
<p>functionality and integrity of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology,</p>
<p>systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you</p>
<p>(learn more in the Data Policy)-in order to provide services that are better,</p>
<p>safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless</p>
<p>and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our</p>
<p>systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care</strong></p>
<p><strong>about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well</p>
<p>as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored</p>
<p>content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that</p>
<p>content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with</p>
<p>others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being</p>
<p>of our community.</p>
<p>The Data Policy</p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings<span style="background-color: red;">. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>Your Commitments</p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us. </p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. </p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under</p>
<p>applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an</p>
<p>applicable denied party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of</p>
<p>our policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information (including registration information).</p>
<p>Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an</p>
<p>account for someone else unless you have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal</strong></p>
<p><strong>or unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community</strong></p>

<p><strong>of the Service.</strong></p>

<p>without our express permission.</p>

<p><strong>(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or</strong></p>
<p><strong>badges of other users.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that</strong></p>
<p><strong>violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property.</strong></p>

<p>intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our</strong></p>
<p><strong>prior written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service. </p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license</strong></p>
<p><strong>to use it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim</p>
<p>ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when</p>
<p>you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights</p>
<p>(like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to</p>
<p>us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license</p>
<p>to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate,</p>
<p>and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and</p>
<p>application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content</p>
<p>or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others</p>
<p>and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and</p>
<p>how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the</p>
<p>Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about</strong></p>
<p><strong>your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored</strong></p>
<p><strong>content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information</p>
<p>about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in</p>
<p>connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you</p>
<p>follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any</p>
<p>compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored</p>
<p>post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with</p>
<p>actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored</p>
<p>content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who</p>
<p>have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad</p>
<p>settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on</strong></p>
<p><strong>your device.</strong></p>
<p>Additional Rights We Retain</p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it</p>
<p>if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes</p>
<p>someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we</p>
<p>provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our</p>
<p>content (but not yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written</p>
<p>permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract</p>
<p>source code from us.</p>

<p>Our Agreement and What Happens if</p>

<p>also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will</p>
<p>be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with</p>
<p>this agreement, those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail</p>

<p>if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or</p>
<p>account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed</p>
<p>the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against</p>
<p>any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,</p>
<p>reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these</p>
<p>Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of</p>
<p>any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any</p>
<p>matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim</p>
<p>without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or</p>
<p>dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram</p>
<p>("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and</p>
<p>class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own</p>
<p>behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final</p>
<p>judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be</p>
<p>arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that</p>
<p>request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain</p>
<p>subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,</p>
<p>if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if</p>
<p>you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the</p>
<p>claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and</p>
<p>we expressly waive a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes</p>
<p>related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform</p>
<p>Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized</p>
<p>ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and</p>
<p>enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. </p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. </p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within</span> 30 days <span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">of th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;"> date that y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u ag</span>re<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">to th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">se</span></p>

<p>commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees</p>
<p>for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely</p>

<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including</p>
<p>rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will</p>
<p>be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a</p>
<p>state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal</p>
<p>jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
