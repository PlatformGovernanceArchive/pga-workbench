to this Service. 


The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.


These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </span>


**The Instagram Service**


We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the


Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we


provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you


love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):


**Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,**


**discover, and share.**


People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared


experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who


and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,


join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,


features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to


experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.


**Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**


We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help


to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might


need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and


violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We


use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform


secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other


Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.


**Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our**


**growing community.**


Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our


Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies


that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large


<span style="background-color: green;">How can we help?


**Help Center**



</span>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and


machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.


Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our


Service.<span style="background-color: red;">


How can we help?


**Help Center**
</span>


**Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook**


**Company Products.**


Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,


insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in


the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.


We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you


use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across


the Facebook Company Products.


**Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**


To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems


around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure


may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their


affiliates.


**Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**


We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as


from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that


we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as


all your other experiences on Instagram.


**Research and innovation.**


We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on


research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our


community.


**The Data Policy**


Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy


explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also


explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy


and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.


**Your Commitments**


In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below


commitments to us.


**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,


but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to


commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.


You must be at least 13 years old<span style="background-color: red;"> or the minimum legal age in your country to use


Instagram</span>.


You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable


laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied


party listing.


We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our


policies.


You must not be a convicted sex offender.


**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad


community requires that we all do our part.


**You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**


You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with


accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for


someone else unless you have their express permission.


**You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or**<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


**unauthorized purpose.**


**You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our**


**policies, including in particular the** **Instagram Community Guidelines****,**


**Instagram Platform Policy****, and** **Music Guidelines****.** Learn how to report conduct or


content in our Help Center.


**You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the**


**Service.**


**You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in**


**unauthorized ways.**


This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without


our express permission.


**You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account**


**(including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or**


**badges of other users.**


**You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates**


**someone else's rights, including intellectual property.**


Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual


property rights, here.


**You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior**


**written consent.**


**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions


that we need to provide the Service.


**We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use**


**it.**

systems.

where your content has been used by others in accordance with this


license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will


continue to apply until that content is deleted); or


where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations


of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as


technically feasible; or


where deletion would restrict our ability to:


investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms


and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of


our products or systems);


protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and


users;


comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of


evidence; or


comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,


law enforcement or a government agency;


in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary


for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary



on a case-by-case basis).

Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is


limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't


know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible


("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,


indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these


Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,


information, or account.<span style="background-color: green;"> Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these


Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past


twelve months.


You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and


against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without


limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way


connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as


required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the


exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and


you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</span>

Class actions and


class arbitrations ar</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own


behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final


judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief)


cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that


claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or


requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.


Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"


court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims


court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general


jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration.</span> T<span style="background-color: green;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">
