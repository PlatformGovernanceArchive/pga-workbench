</span>


Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3


("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.


2. Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that


Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode


and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.


3. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.


4. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the


rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate,


misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark

</span>


post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.


5. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Instagram ("Instagram Content"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright,


trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Instagram, Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram


Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices


incorporated in or accompanying the Instagram Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on,


perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Instagram Content.


6. The Instagram name and logo are trademarks of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior


written permission of Instagram, except in accordance with our brand guidelines, available here:


http://help.instagram.com/customer/portal/articles/182487. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are


service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Instagram, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior


written permission from Instagram.


7. Although it is Instagram's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be


interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of


telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Instagram reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason,


without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Instagram, including, without limitation, in order to


comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to


maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the


Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or


discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security


and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.

obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal


responsibility for that Content.


9. Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, as between you and


Instagram, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You


acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Instagram is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that


your decision to submit any Content does not place Instagram in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the


general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of


Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.


10. It is Instagram's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have


specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings<span style="background-color: red;"> if</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">if </span>your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Instagram does not accept unsolicited


materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us


content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Instagram is free to use any such content, information,


ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and


services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Instagram's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,


trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above


("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Instagram (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard<span style="background-color: red;"> to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to </span>your relationship with Instagram, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of


<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of


consumer-related disputes and you and Instagram hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your<span style="background-color: red;"> local</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">local </span>"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>in claims brought<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>American Arbitration Association is<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>either Instagram or you can elect to have<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>the award rendered by the arbitrator may be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.


You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Instagram can require the other to participate in an arbitration


proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Instagram in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.

</span>want to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>opt out of this arbitration agreement.


If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then<span style="background-color: red;"> all of</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">all of </span>the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your<span style="background-color: red;"> relationship</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">relationship </span>with Instagram.


**Time Limitation on Claims**


You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Instagram must be filed within one year after such<span style="background-color: red;"> claim</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">claim </span>arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.


**Governing Law & Venue**

courts</span> <span style="background-color: green;">courts


</span>located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.


If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of<span style="background-color: red;"> competent</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">competent </span>jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability<span style="background-color: red;"> of any</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">of any </span>remaining provisions. Instagram's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be<span style="background-color: red;"> construed as a</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">construed as a </span>waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or<span style="background-color: red;"> condition or any</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">condition or any </span>other term or condition. Instagram reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not<span style="background-color: red;"> apply to disputes</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span><span style="background-color: green;">apply to disputes </span>arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all<span style="background-color: red;"> of your transactions</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">of your transactions </span>with Instagram.

</span>or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Instagram. Any purported<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>assignment or delegation by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you without the appropriate prior written consent of Instagram will be null and void. Instagram may assign these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Terms of Use or any rights<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>and will not affect the validity<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">
