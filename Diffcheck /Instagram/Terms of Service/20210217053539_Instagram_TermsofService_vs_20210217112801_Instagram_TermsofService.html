<p>Terms of Use</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram! </p>
<p>These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly</p>
<p>state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the</p>
<p>Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account</p>
<p>or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply</p>
<p>to this Service. </p>
<p>The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instagram Service</strong></p>
<p>We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the</p>
<p>Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we</p>
<p>provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you</p>
<p>love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate,</strong></p>
<p><strong>discover, and share.</strong></p>
<p>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared</p>
<p>experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who</p>
<p>and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find,</p>
<p>join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,</p>
<p>features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to</p>
<p>experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong></p>
<p>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help</p>
<p>to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might</p>
<p>need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and</p>
<p>violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We</p>
<p>use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform</p>
<p>secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our</strong></p>
<p><strong>growing community.</strong></p>
<p>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our</p>
<p>Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies</p>
<p>that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large</p>
<p>scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company Products.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,</p>
<p>insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in</p>
<p>the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.</p>
<p>We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across</p>
<p>the Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our Service.</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems</p>
<p>around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this</p>
<p>global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This</p>
<p>infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland</p>
<p>Limited, or their affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong></p>
<p>We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as</p>
<p>from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that</p>
<p>we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as</p>
<p>all your other experiences on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on</p>
<p>research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p><strong>How Our Service Is Funded</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you</p>
<p>acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to</p>
<p>promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as</p>
<p>information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell</p>
<p>your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be</p>
<p>interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help</p>
<p>them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies</p>
<p>you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact</p>
<p>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about</p>
<p>how Instagram ads work here.</p>
<p>You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote</p>
<p>products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner</p>
<p>mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</p>
<p>explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Facebook Products. It also</p>
<p>explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram Privacy</p>
<p>and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
<p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below</p>
<p>commitments to us.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Use Instagram.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible,</p>
<p>but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to</p>
<p>commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable</p>
<p>laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied</p>
<p>party listing.</p>
<p>We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can't Use Instagram.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad</p>
<p>community requires that we all do our part.</p>
<p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with</p>
<p>accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may</p>
<p>include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or</p>
<p>something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you</p>
<p>have their express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our</strong></p>
<p><strong>policies, including in particular the</strong> <strong>Instagram Community Guidelines</strong><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies</strong><strong>, and</strong> <strong>Music Guidelines</strong>.</p>
<p>If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies,</p>
<p>which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or</p>
<p>content in our Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making</p>
<p>fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.</p>
<p><strong>You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in</strong></p>
<p><strong>unauthorized ways.</strong></p>
<p>This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without</p>
<p>our express permission.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Service.</strong></p>
<p>This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including</p>
<p>your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or</p>
<p>request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without</strong></p>
<p><strong>permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including</strong></p>
<p><strong>intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark</strong></p>
<p><strong>infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
<p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and</p>
<p>related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all</p>
<p>necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report</p>
<p>content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer</strong></p>
<p><strong>our products or their components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior</strong></p>
<p><strong>written consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions</p>
<p>that we need to provide the Service.</p>
<p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use</strong></p>
<p><strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of</p>
<p>your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your</p>
<p>content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal</p>
<p>permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share,</p>
<p>post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or</p>
<p>videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute,</p>
<p>modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works</p>
<p>of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will</p>
<p>end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content</p>
<p>individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use</p>
<p>information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and</p>
<p>visit the Instagram Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your</strong></p>
<p><strong>relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
<p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about</p>
<p>your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection</p>
<p>with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage</p>
<p>with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows</p>
<p>of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts</p>
<p>can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We</p>
<p>will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.</p>
<p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your</strong></p>
<p><strong>device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong></p>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we</p>
<p>believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's</p>
<p>intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make</p>
<p>available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide</p>
<p>that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not</p>
<p>yours).</p>
<p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as</p>
<p>expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to</p>
<p>modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source</p>
<p>code from us.</p>
<p><strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong></p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that</p>
<p>it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community</p>
<p>Guidelines), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to</p>
<p>provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or</p>
<p>disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products)</p>
<p>immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal</p>
<p>exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram</p>
<p>Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate</p>
<p>or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service,</p>
<p>or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you</p>
<p>believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or</p>
<p>permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to</p>
<p>delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more</p>
<p>than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the</p>
<p>deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being</p>
<p>undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to</p>
<p>these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us</p>
<p>up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion</p>
<p>process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this</p>
<p>license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will</p>
<p>continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
<p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations</p>
<p>of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as</p>
<p>technically feasible; or</p>
<p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of</p>
<p>our products or systems);</p>
<p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and</p>
<p>users;</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of</p>
<p>evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,</p>
<p>law enforcement, or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our</p>
<p>Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account</p>
<p>is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your</p>
<p>use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If</p>
<p>you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an</p>
<p>opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our</p>
<p>agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to</p>
<p>the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,</p>
<p>those other terms will govern.</p>
<p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
<p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If</p>
<p>we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can</p>
<p>invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a</p>
<p>dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
<p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our</p>
<p>consent.</p>
<p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if</p>
<p>our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or</p>
<p>will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible</p>
<p>for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including</p>
<p>unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and</p>
<p>features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is</p>
<p>limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't</p>
<p>know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible</p>
<p>("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these</p>
<p>Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,</p>
<p>information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these</p>
<p>Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and</p>
<p>against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without</p>
<p>limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as</p>
<p>required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the</p>
<p>exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and</p>
<p>you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Handle Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>or Instagram ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual</strong></p>
<p><strong>basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted</strong>; you and we may</p>
<p>bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other</p>
<p>Instagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a</p>
<p>request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's</p>
<p>limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.</p>
<p>All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>
<p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims"</p>
<p>court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims</p>
<p>court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general</p>
<p>jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The</p>
<p>American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules. <strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
<p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:</p>
<p>disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of</p>
<p>our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service</p>
<p>in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to</p>
<p>the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
<p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these</p>
<p>Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement</p>
<p>that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,</p>
<p>CA 94025.</p>
<p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written</p>
<p>Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email</p>
<p>address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description</p>
<p>of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should</p>
<p>be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.</p>
<p>Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice</p>
<p>of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other</p>
<p>appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after</p>
<p>the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>
<p>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator</p>
<p>fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you</p>
<p>timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of</p>
<p>arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,</p>
<p>including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
<p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it</p>
<p>will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of</p>
<p>California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to</p>
<p>the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such</p>
<p>claim.</p>
<p>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with</p>
<p>federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Material.</strong></p>
<p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them</p>
<p>without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are</p>
<p>under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Updating These Terms</strong></p>
<p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these</p>
<p>Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required</p>
<p>by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to</p>
<p>these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if</p>
<p>you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want</p>
<p>to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. </p>
