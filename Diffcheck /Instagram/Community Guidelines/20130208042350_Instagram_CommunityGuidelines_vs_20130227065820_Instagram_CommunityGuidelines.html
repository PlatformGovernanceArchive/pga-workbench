<p><strong>2. Keep your clothes on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Be respectful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Don’t spam.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. HAVE FUN!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p><strong>The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best practices as</strong></p>
<p><strong>a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our</strong> <strong>Terms of Use</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Do share photos that you’ve taken.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos, but we have to ask that you don’t share</strong></p>
<p><strong>photos of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos they have uploaded using our</strong></p>
<p><strong>service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If you want to express your excitement over a</strong></p>
<p><strong>beautiful photo, it’s best to</strong> <strong>double tap on the image to like it</strong><strong>!</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Do share photos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your photos are visible to people as young as 13</strong></p>
<p><strong>years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos, we have to keep our product and the photos</strong></p>
<p><strong>within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In other words, please do not</strong></p>
<p><strong>post nudity or mature content of any kind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share images on Instagram,</strong></p>
<p><strong>which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or believe. We ask that</strong></p>
<p><strong>all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users often</strong></p>
<p><strong>notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of users to</strong></p>
<p><strong>gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Do have fun!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs of your life with others, and see the</strong></p>
<p><strong>world through others’ eyes. It’s photo sharing reinvented, so have fun!</strong></p>
<p><strong>What not to do:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a</strong> <strong>disabled account</strong><strong>, or</strong></p>
<p><strong>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Don’t share photos that aren’t yours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This includes other people’s photos, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Don’t share photos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you wouldn’t show the photo you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents,</strong></p>
<p><strong>you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile photo. Accounts found</strong></p>
<p><strong>sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Don’t share photos of illegal content.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If we find you sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs of extreme violence or gore,</strong></p>
<p><strong>your account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to</strong></p>
<p><strong>the authorities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Don’t spam.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful photos of their lives, and when you engage in self-</strong></p>
<p><strong>promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that moment with you</strong></p>
<p><strong>feel sad inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service manipulation in order to</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p><strong>Search the Help Center</strong></p>
<p><strong>self-promote, and extends to commercial spam comments, such as discount codes or URLs to websites.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram meaningful and genuine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives through</strong></p>
<p><strong>photographs. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate others. If we receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>valid complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your account. Alternatively, we’d</strong></p>
<p><strong>recommend users</strong> <strong>block</strong> <strong>all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further issues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs, any</strong></p>
<p><strong>account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or to</strong></p>
<p><strong>cut, harm themselves, or commit suicide will result in a disabled account without warning. We believe</strong></p>
<p><strong>that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness, come together for support</strong></p>
<p><strong>and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place for active promotion or</strong></p>
<p><strong>glorification of self-harm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional things to remember</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If you</strong></p>
<p><strong>are offended by a photo that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest you navigate</strong></p>
<p><strong>away from the account, or even use our</strong> <strong>blocking feature</strong><strong>. If you are unsure about the content, you can</strong></p>
<p><strong>report it utilizing our</strong> <strong>built-in reporting functionality</strong> <strong>in order to bring it to the Instagram Team’s attention.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you find that one of your images has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is likely</strong></p>
<p><strong>a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the image &amp; politely ask that</strong></p>
<p><strong>they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please</strong> <strong>file a DMCA report</strong> <strong>so that we may investigate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream in</strong></p>
<p><strong>order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about resolving the</strong></p>
<p><strong>issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as harassment, which violates</strong></p>
<p><strong>our guidelines.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can</strong> <strong>send a report</strong> <strong>to the Instagram Team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs our</strong></p>
<p><strong>attention, this includes image descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</strong></p>
<p><strong>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will help</strong></p>
<p><strong>keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</strong></p>
