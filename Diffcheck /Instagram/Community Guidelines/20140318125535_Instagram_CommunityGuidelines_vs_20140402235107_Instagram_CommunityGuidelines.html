<p>The Long</p>
<p>The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best</p>
<p>practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms</p>
<p>of Use.</p>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you</p>
<p>don’t share photos or videos of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos or</p>
<p>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If</p>
<p>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to double tap on the</p>
<p>post to like it!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young</p>
<p>as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our</p>
<p>product and the content within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In</p>
<p>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do treat others as you would like to be treated.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on</p>
<p>Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or</p>
<p>believe. We ask that all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have meaningful &amp; genuine interactions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users</p>
<p>often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of</p>
<p>users to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,</p>
<p>and see the world through others’ eyes.</p>
<p>What not to do:</p>
<p>It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or</p>
<p>discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.</p>
<p>Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or</p>
<p>your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile</p>
<p>photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to</p>
<p>Instagram may be discontinued.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of</p>
<p>extreme violence or gore, your account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which</p>
<p>may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it is neither possible nor permitted to</p>
<p>complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos are</p>
<p>promoting the sale of regulated goods or services, including firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or adult</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Instagram </span>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center</p>
<p>products, we expect you to make sure you’re following the law and to encourage others to do the</p>
<p>same.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t spam.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful moments from their lives, and when you</p>
<p>engage in self-promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that</p>
<p>moment with you feel sad inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service</p>
<p>manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam comments, such as</p>
<p>discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram</p>
<p>meaningful and genuine.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t be rude.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives</p>
<p>through photos and videos. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate</p>
<p>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct, we’ll send a warning or disable your</p>
<p>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend users block all meanies &amp; trolls to prevent further issues.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't promote or glorify self-harm.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and</p>
<p>videos, any account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating</p>
<p>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit suicide will result in a disabled account without</p>
<p>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness,</p>
<p>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place</p>
<p>for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.</p>
<p>Additional things to remember</p>
<p>Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If</p>
<p>you are offended by a photo or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest</p>
<p>you navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the</p>
<p>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the</p>
<p>Instagram Team’s attention.</p>
<p>If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is</p>
<p>likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post &amp; politely</p>
<p>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream</p>
<p>in order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about</p>
<p>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as</p>
<p>harassment, which violates our guidelines.</p>
<p>If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.</p>
<p>Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs</p>
<p>our attention, this includes image or video descriptions &amp; dates, URLs, and valid usernames.</p>
<p>If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing</p>
<p>service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will</p>
<p>help keep Instagram a safe &amp; fun place for everyone.</p>
