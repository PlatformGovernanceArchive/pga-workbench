<p>Community Guidelines</p>
<p><strong><em>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</em></strong> <em>As people around the world confront this</em></p>
<p><em>unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people</em></p>
<p><em>from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19. We’re working to remove content that has</em></p>
<p><em>the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm,</em></p>
<p><em>sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that</em></p>
<p><em>contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm. As the situation evolves, we continue to look at</em></p>
<p><em>content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy</em></p>
<p><em>guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Short</strong></p>
<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster</p>
<p>this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on</p>
<p>Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.</p>
<p><strong>The Long</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By</p>
<p>using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines</p>
<p>and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or</p>
<p>other restrictions.</p>
<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community</p>
<p>Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest</p>
<p>value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.</strong></p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and</p>
<p>don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.</p>
<p>Learn more about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong></p>
<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or</p>
<p>creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes</p>
<p>photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and</p>
<p>close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-</p>
<p>mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings</p>
<p>and sculptures is OK, too.</p>
<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we</p>
<p>may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared</p>
<p>with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our</p>
<p>Tips for Parents page.</p>
<p><strong>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive</p>
<p>comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their</p>
<p>consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or</p>
<p>other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits</p>
<p>to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us</p>
<p>with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the</p>
<p>purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the law.</strong></p>
<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering</p>
<p>sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private</p>
<p>individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not</p>
<p>allowed. Instagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-</p>
<p>and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered</p>
<p>species or their parts.</p>
<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts</p>
<p>promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Cent<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e</span></strong></p>
<p>written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to</p>
<p>post intimate images of others.</p>
<p><strong>Respect other members of the Instagram community.</strong></p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats</p>
<p>or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal</p>
<p>information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do</p>
<p>generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large</p>
<p>public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,</p>
<p>sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When</p>
<p>hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those</p>
<p>instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of</p>
<p>physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review</p>
<p>reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</strong></p>
<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult</p>
<p>issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create</p>
<p>awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding</p>
<p>information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and</p>
<p>we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying</p>
<p>victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p><strong>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.</strong></p>
<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some</p>
<p>of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use</p>
<p>Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays</p>
<p>appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or</p>
<p>educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a</p>
<p>warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is</p>
<p>never allowed.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>Help us keep the community strong:<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span></p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think</p>
<p>may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global</p>
<p>team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t</p>
<p>meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can</p>
<p>still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,</p>
<p>such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We</p>
<p>may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.</p>
<p>You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,</p>
<p>you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment</p>
<p>on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</p>
<p>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the</p>
<p>community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting</p>
<p>on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright</p>
<p>report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't</p>
<p>target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation</p>
<p>because that may be classified as harassment.</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or</p>
<p>threat to public safety.</p>
