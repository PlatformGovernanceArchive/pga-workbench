<span style="background-color: green;">The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best

practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms

of Use.

What to do:

1. </span>**Do share photos and videos that you’ve taken.**

Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos and videos, but we have to ask that you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>don’t share photos or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>videos of someone else’s life. Since people own the rights to all photos or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>videos they have uploaded using our service, we ask<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>that you respect their copyright ownership. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo or video, it’s best to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>double tap on the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>post to like it!

<span style="background-color: red;">1

</span><span style="background-color: green;">2. </span>**Do share photos and videos that are safe for people of all ages.**

Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your posts are visible to people as young<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>as 13 years old. While we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>respect the artistic integrity of photos and videos, we have to keep our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>product and the content within it in line with our App<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>other words, please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.

<span style="background-color: green;">3. **Do treat others as you would like to be treated.**

People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share moments on

Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or

believe. We ask that everyone be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.

4. **Do have meaningful & genuine interactions.**

Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. People

often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of

accounts to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.

5. **Do have fun!**

Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs and videos of your life with others,

and see the world through others’ eyes.

What not to do:

It is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or

discontinued access to Instagram, without warning.

1. **Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours.**

This includes other people’s posts, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet.

Accounts that solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.

<span style="background-color: green;">your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile

photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to

Instagram may be discontinued. While we know that families use Instagram to capture and share

photos of their children, we may remove images that show nude or partially nude children for safety

reasons. Even when these images are uploaded with the best of intentions, this content could be re-

shared and used by other people in unanticipated and inappropriate ways. You can learn more on

Additional things to remember

If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing service, as Instagram may

not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will help keep Instagram a safe & fun place for everyone.

shouldn’t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile photo. Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content

will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued. While we know that families use Instagram to capture and

share photos of their children, we may remove images that show nude or partially nude children for safety reasons. Even when

these images are uploaded with the best of intentions, this content could be re-shared and used by other people in

unanticipated and inappropriate ways. You can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.

**Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.**

If you are reported for sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs or videos of extreme violence or gore, your

account may be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities. Additionally, it

is neither possible nor permitted to complete transactions involving regulated goods on our platform. If your photos or videos

are promoting the sale of regulated goods or services, including firearms, alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or adult

products, we expect you to make sure you’re following the law and to encourage others to do the same.

3

**Don’t spam.**

Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful moments from their lives, and when you engage in self-promotional

behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes people who have shared that moment with you feel sad inside. This guideline

includes repetitive comments, as well as service manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam

comments, such as </span>discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> meaningful and</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">g</span><span style="background-color: green;">m</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">u</span>in<span style="background-color: green;">gful and g</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nuine</span>.

<span style="background-color: red;">4

</span><span style="background-color: green;">5. </span>**Don’t be rude.**

Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>through photos and videos. It<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>others. If we receive valid complaints about your conduct,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>we’ll send a warning or disable your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>account. Alternatively, we’d recommend people block all meanies & trolls to prevent further<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>issues.

<span style="background-color: red;">5

</span><span style="background-color: green;">6. </span>**Don't promote or glorify self-harm.**

While Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>videos, any account found<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or commit<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>suicide will result in a disabled account without<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>warning. We believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>create awareness,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that Instagram is not the place<span style="background-color: red;"> for</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">for </span>active promotion or glorification of self-harm.

<span style="background-color: red;">6</span><span style="background-color: green;">Additional things to remember</span>

Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you are offended by a photo<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>or video that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you navigate away from the account, or even use our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>blocking feature. If you are unsure about the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>bring it to the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Instagram Team’s attention.

If you find that one of your posts has been uploaded to another person’s profile, try not to panic. It is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>likely a misunderstanding<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the post & politely<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>work, please file a DMCA report so that we may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>investigate.

You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream<span style="background-color: red;"> in order to draw attention to</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">in order to draw attention to </span>the situation or person, but that’s often not the best way to go about<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>person, as it may be classified as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>harassment, which violates our guidelines.

If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Please provide all<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our attention, this includes image or video<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>descriptions & dates, URLs, and valid usernames.

<span style="background-color: green;">If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing

service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will

help keep Instagram a safe & fun place for everyone.
