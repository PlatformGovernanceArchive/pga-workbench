The detailed Community Guidelines below have been created in order to help you understand the best

practices as a member of the Instagram community. By utilizing Instagram you are also subject to our Terms

of Use.

What to do:

1. **Do share photos <span style="background-color: green;">and videos </span>that you’ve taken.**

Instagram is a great way to share your life through photos<span style="background-color: green;"> and videos</span>, but we have to ask that you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>don’t share<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>phot<span style="background-color: green;">os or vide</span>os of someone else’s life. Since users own the rights to all photos <span style="background-color: red;">they have upl</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">aded using ou</span>r

<span style="background-color: green;">videos they have uploaded using our </span>service, we ask that you respect their copyright ownership. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you want to express your excitement<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>over a beautiful photo<span style="background-color: green;"> or video</span>, it’s best to double tap on the<span style="background-color: red;"> image</span><span style="background-color: green;">

post</span> to like it!

2. **Do share photos <span style="background-color: green;">and videos </span>that are safe for people of all ages.**

Remember that our community is a diverse one, and that your p<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">o</span>s are visible to people as young

as 13 years old. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos<span style="background-color: green;"> and videos</span>, we have to keep our<span style="background-color: red;"> product and</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">the </span>p<span style="background-color: red;">h</span><span style="background-color: green;">r</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">duc</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> and the c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">ntent</span> within it in line with our App Store’s rating for nudity and mature content. In<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>other words,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>please do not post nudity or mature content of any kind.

3. **Do treat others as you would like to be treated.**

People from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share <span style="background-color: red;">i</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ag</span><span style="background-color: green;">om</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nt</span>s on

Instagram, which is great, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or

believe. We ask that all users be polite and respectful in their interactions with other members.

4. **Do have meaningful & genuine interactions.**

Self-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users

often notice when you have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of

users to gain followers in return, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.

5. **Do have fun!**

Instagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs <span style="background-color: green;">and videos </span>of your life with others,<span style="background-color: red;"> and see the</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and see the </span>world through others’ eyes.<span style="background-color: green;">

<span style="background-color: green;">moment </span>with you feel sad inside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service

manipulation in order to self-promote, and extends to commercial spam comments, such as

discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your interactions on Instagram

meaningful and genuine.

5. **Don’t be rude.**

Instagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives

through photo<span style="background-color: red;">gr</span><span style="background-color: green;">s </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ph</span><span style="background-color: green;">nd video</span>s.

<span style="background-color: green;">account. </span>Alternatively, we’d recommend users block all meanies & trolls to prevent further issues.

6. **Don't promote or glorify self-harm.**

videos</span>, any<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>account found encouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>believe that communication regarding these behaviors in order to create awareness,<span style="background-color: red;"> come together</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">for active </span>promotion or glorification of self-harm.

Additional things to remember

Instagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If

you are offended by a photo <span style="background-color: green;">or video </span>that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we’d suggest<span style="background-color: red;"> you</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">you </span>navigate away from the account, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the

content, you can report it utilizing our built-in reporting functionality in order to bring it to the

Instagram Team’s attention.

If you find that one of your <span style="background-color: green;">post</span><span style="background-color: red;">image</span>s has been uploaded to another user’s profile, try not to panic. It is

likely a misunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the <span style="background-color: green;">post</span><span style="background-color: red;">image</span> &<span style="background-color: red;">

politely</span> <span style="background-color: green;">politely

</span>ask that they take the content down. If that doesn’t work, please file a DMCA report so that<span style="background-color: red;">

we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we</span><span style="background-color: red;">may</span> <span style="background-color: green;">may

</span>investigate.

You might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream

in order to draw attention to the situation or user, but that’s often not the best way to go about

resolving the issue. We do not encourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as

harassment, which violates our guidelines.

If you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team.

Please provide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs

our attention, this includes image<span style="background-color: green;"> or video</span> descriptions & dates, URLs, and valid usernames.

If you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we’d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing

service, as Instagram may not be the best place for you. We value these guidelines, and believe that they will

help keep Instagram a safe & fun place for everyone.
