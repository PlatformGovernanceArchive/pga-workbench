Community Guidelines

**The Short**

We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster

this community. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on

Instagram, don’t spam people or post nudity.

**The Long**

Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time

thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.

We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By

using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines

and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or

other restrictions.

**Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.**

As always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and

don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post.

Learn more about intellectual property rights.

**Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.**

We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or

creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes

photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and

close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-

mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings

and sculptures is OK, too.

People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we

may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared

with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our

Tips for Parents page.

**Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.**

Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive

comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their

consent.

**Follow the law.**

Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering

sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it’s legal in your

region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other

regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online

lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.

We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to

post intimate images of others.

**Respect other members of the Instagram community.**

We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats

or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal

information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do

generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large

public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.

It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,

sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When

hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those

instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.

Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of

physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review

reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.

We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some

of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use

Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays

appropriate for everyone.

We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or

educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a

warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is

never allowed.

Help us keep the community strong:</span>

Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think

may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global

team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t

meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Instagram account, you can

still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible,

such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We

may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.

You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens,

you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment

on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.

Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the

community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting

on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright

report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't

target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation

because that may be classified as harassment.

We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or

threat to public safety.
