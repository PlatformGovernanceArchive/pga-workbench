<p>Data Policy</p>
<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram, Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook</p>
<p>(Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and</p>
<p>information in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>I. What kinds of information do we</p>
<p>collect?</p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use our</p>
<p>Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content,</p>
<p>and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or</p>
<p>about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo</p>
<p>or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through</p>
<p>features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest</p>
<p>masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera</p>
<p>formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you</p>
<p>and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes</p>
<p>described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the</p>
<p>things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in</p>
<p>your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your religious views,</p>
<p>political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other</p>
<p>information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade</p>
<p>union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws</p>
<p>of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people,</p>
<p>Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you</p>
<p>interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with</p>
<p>the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you</p>
<p>choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book</p>
<p>or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and</p>
<p>others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such</p>
<p>as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the</p>
<p>How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Help Center</strong></p>
<p>actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time,</p>
<p>frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're</p>
<p>using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other</p>
<p>content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you</p>
<p>use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our</p>
<p>Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you</p>
<p>make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information</p>
<p>about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such</p>
<p>as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account</p>
<p>and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also</p>
<p>receive and analyze content, communications and information that other</p>
<p>people provide when they use our Products. This can include information</p>
<p>about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a</p>
<p>message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of</p>
<p>our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or</p>
<p>features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your</p>
<p>laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad</p>
<p>we showed you on your phone on a different device. </p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes: </p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and</p>
<p>software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space,</p>
<p>browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed</p>
<p>on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded,</p>
<p>or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from</p>
<p>games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers</p>
<p>unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the same device or</p>
<p>account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through</p>
<p>device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or</p>
<p>photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile</p>
<p>operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address,</p>
<p>connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that</p>
<p>are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a</p>
<p>video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs</p>
<p>and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through</p>
<p>Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the</p>
<p>Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.</p>
<p>These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—</p>
<p>including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you</p>
<p>have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game</p>
<p>developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could</p>
<p>tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information</p>
<p>about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data</p>
<p>providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. </p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third</p>
<p>parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights</p>
<p>to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more</p>
<p>about the types of partners we receive data from. </p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook</p>
<p>Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p>II. How do we use this information?</p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,</p>
<p>Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our</p>
<p>Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,</p>
<p>we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the</p>
<p>data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special</p>
<p>protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;</p>
<p>and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and</p>
<p>off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more</p>
<p>about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect</p>
<p>information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices</p>
<p>to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that</p>
<p>you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience</p>
<p>more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration</p>
<p>information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when</p>
<p>you sign up for an account on a different Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as</p>
<p>your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the</p>
<p>businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can</p>
<p>be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect</p>
<p>it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook</p>
<p>Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to</p>
<p>develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The</p>
<p>face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use</p>
<p>face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook</p>
<p>Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram</p>
<p>experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether</p>
<p>we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about</p>
<p>you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show</p>
<p>you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices</p>
<p>over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such</p>
<p>as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other</p>
<p>partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people</p>
<p>interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share</p>
<p>information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful</p>
<p>conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the</p>
<p>integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate</p>
<p>suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center</p>
<p>and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we</p>
<p>have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more</p>
<p>about our research programs.</p>
<p>III. How is this information shared?</p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you</p>
<p>select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,</p>
<p>or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram</p>
<p>to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can</p>
<p>see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on</p>
<p>our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also</p>
<p>let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if</p>
<p>they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any</p>
<p>information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile</p>
<p>on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram</p>
<p>account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other</p>
<p>people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send</p>
<p>public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public</p>
<p>information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through</p>
<p>third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as</p>
<p>TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can</p>
<p>see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off</p>
<p>our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to</p>
<p>specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that</p>
<p>content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone</p>
<p>else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to</p>
<p>anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change</p>
<p>the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with</p>
<p>the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a</p>
<p>Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have</p>
<p>shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on</p>
<p>our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,</p>
<p>Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,</p>
<p>or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what</p>
<p>you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game</p>
<p>developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game</p>
<p>or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your</p>
<p>public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps</p>
<p>and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose</p>
<p>to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information</p>
<p>about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,</p>
<p>of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this</p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have</p>
<p>access to all information you choose to share with them, including information</p>
<p>your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in</em></p>
<p><em>3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will</em></p>
<p><em>reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,</p>
<p>we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our</p>
<p>Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,</p>
<p>which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and</p>
<p>we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share</p>
<p>information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses</p>
<p>understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos</p>
<p>and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page</p>
<p>admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number</p>
<p>of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as</p>
<p>well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them</p>
<p>understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads</p>
<p>and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give</p>
<p>us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest</p>
<p>information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman</p>
<p>between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software</p>
<p>engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm</p>
<p>which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an</p>
<p>advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide</p>
<p>analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,</p>
<p>analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating</p>
<p>payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics</p>
<p>to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our</p>
<p>business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of</p>
<p>general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in</p>
<p>the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or</p>
<p>others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>IV. How do the Facebook Companies</p>
<p>work together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p>V. How can I manage information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>VI. How do we respond to legal</p>
<p>requests or prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal</p>
<p>requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,</p>
<p>unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or</p>
<p>illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or</p>
<p>others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive</p>
<p>information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud,</p>
<p>abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p>VII. How do we operate and transfer</p>
<p>data as part of our global services?</p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in</p>
<p>accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p>VIII. How will we notify you of changes</p>
<p>to this policy?</p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p>IX. How to contact Facebook with</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have</p>
<p>questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve</p>
<p>disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through</p>
<p>TrustArc. You can contact TrustArc through its website.</p>
