**Device signals:** Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi

access points, beacons, and cell towers.

**Data from device settings:** information you allow us to receive through

device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or

photos.

**Network and connections:** information such as the name of your mobile

operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address,

connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that

are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a

video from your phone to your TV.

**Cookie data:** data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs

and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook

Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.

**Information from partners**

Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through

Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the

Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.

These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—

including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you

make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you

have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game

developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could

tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information

about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data

providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third

parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights

to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more

about the types of partners we receive data from. 

To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook

Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies

Policy.

<span style="background-color: red;">connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that

are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a

video from your phone to your TV.

**Cookie data:** data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs

and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook

Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.

**Information from partners**

Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through

Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the

Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.

These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—

including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you

make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you

have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game

developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could

tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information

about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data

providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third

parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights

to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more

about the types of partners we receive data from. 

To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook

Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies

Policy.

II. How do we use this information?

We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to

provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the

Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:

**Provide, personalize and improve our Products.**

We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to

personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,

Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or

events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our

Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,

we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the

data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special

protections you choose to provide where you have given your explicit consent);

how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things

you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products. Learn more

about how we use information about you to personalize your Facebook and

Instagram experience, including features, content and recommendations in

Facebook Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the ads

that you see.

**Information across Facebook Products and devices:** We connect

information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices

to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook

Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that

you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or

communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience

more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration

information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when

you sign up for an account on a different Product.

**Location-related information:** We use location-related information-such as

your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the

businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our

Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can

be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect

it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook

Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).

**Product research and development:** We use the information we have to

develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and

research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.

**Face recognition:** If you have it turned on, we use face recognition

technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The

face-recognition templates we create are data with special protections under

EU law. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control

our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-

recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first,

and you will have control over whether </span>we use this technology for you.

**Ads and other sponsored content:** We use the information we have about

you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to

select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show

you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices

over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the

Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

**Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.**

We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such

as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other

partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,

and understand the types of people who use their services and how people

interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share

information with these partners.

**Promote safety, integrity and security.**

We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful

conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the

integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of

Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate

suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when

someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center

and Instagram Security Tips.

**Communicate with you.**

We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,

communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies

and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact

us.

**Research and innovate for social good.**

We use the information we have to conduct and support research and

innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,

public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we

have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more

about our research programs.

III. How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the

audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you

select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,

or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram

to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can

see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on

our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also

let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. 

**Public information** can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if

they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any

information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile

on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram

account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other

people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send

public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook

Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public

information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through

third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as

TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 

Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on

Facebook and Instagram.

**Content others share or reshare about you**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can

see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off

our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you

shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to

specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that

content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality

experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone

else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to

anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change

the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with

the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a

Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you

in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have

shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.

**Information about your active status or presence on our Products.**

People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on

our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,

Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.**

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,

or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what

you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook

friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game

developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game

or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.

Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your

public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps

and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose

to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive

any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information

about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,

of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected

by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this

one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and

Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have

access to all information you choose to share with them, including information

your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. 

*Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even*

*further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'*

*access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in*

*3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will*

*reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only*

*name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.*

*Requesting any other data will require our approval.*

**New owner.**

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,

we may transfer your information to the new owner.

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our

Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,

which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to

people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and

we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use

and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share

information with:

**Partners who use our analytics services.**

We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses

understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos

and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page

admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number

of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as

well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them

understand interactions with their Page or account.

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads

and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that

personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that

by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give

us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest

information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman

between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software

engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm

which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an

advertiser.

**Measurement partners.**

We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide

analytics and measurement reports to our partners.

**Partners offering goods and services in our Products.**

When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a

seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public

information and other information you share with them, as well as the

information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact

details.

**Vendors and service providers.**

We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who

support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,

analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating

payments or conducting surveys.

**Researchers and academics.**

We also provide information and content to research partners and academics

to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our

business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of

general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and

well-being.

**Law enforcement or legal requests**

We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in

the circumstances outlined below.

Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or

others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram

Settings.

IV. How do the Facebook Companies

work together?

Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other

Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,

relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.

We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these

purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.

For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its

service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram

or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook

Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different

Facebook Company Products.

determinati</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">n that depends on things like the nature o</span>f<span style="background-color: green;"> the data, why it is collected and

processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you

search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your

search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit

a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy

30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and

cookie data obtained through social plugins. 

When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and

status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that

others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't

want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can

deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the

users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or

fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.

We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or

others:

In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have

a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal

requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief

that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,

and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.

When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,

unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or

illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or

others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or
