<p>content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software</p>
<p>provided on or in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and</p>
<p>other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use,</p>

<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help</p>
<p>you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,</p>
<p>changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii)</p>
<p>third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or</p>
<p>not someone associated with your contact is using Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party</p>
<p>service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then simply type a name to search and we will</p>
<p>perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Invite friends" feature, you may select</p>
<p>a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that</p>
<p>you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from</p>
<p>your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your</p>
<p>device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect</p>
<p>and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular</p>
<p>individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information</p>
<p>about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by</p>
<p>us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can</p>
<p>also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")</p>
<p>address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,</p>
<p>landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then</p>
<p>help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and</p>
<p>improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or</p>
<p>remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with</p>
<p>your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device</p>
<p>hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or</p>
<p>others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of</p>
<p>device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a</p>
<p>piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo),</p>
<p>geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and</p>
<p>more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the</p>
<p>photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or</p>
<p>activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag)</p>
<p>associated with that Event.</p>
<p><strong>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which Instagram is a part) without your</p>
<p>consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data (such as</p>
<p>usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.), with organizations that help us provide the Service to you</p>
<p>("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service</p>
<p>under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad</p>
<p>networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information</p>
<p>with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as</p>
<p>controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting.</p>
<p>Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under</p>
<p>our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if</p>
<p>other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a</p>
<p>merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other</p>
<p>information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The</p>
<p>buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Instances where we may be required to share your information:</strong></p>
<p>Instagram will disclose your information where required to do so by law or by judicial process or if we reasonably believe that such action is</p>
<p>necessary to:</p>
<p>comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement</p>
<p>enforce our Terms of Use</p>
<p>protect the security or integrity of our Service</p>
<p>exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Instagram, our Users or others</p>

<p>governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal</p>
<p>information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot</p>
<p>ensure the security of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,</p>
<p>disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
