<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by</p>
<p>teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating</p>
<p>with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being</p>
<p>able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>
<p>We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you</p>
<p>understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your</p>
<p>Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're</p>
<p>looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core</p>
<p>features of the app that you've come to know and love.</p>
<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected</p>
<p>prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.</p>
<p>Effective date: January 19, 2013</p>
<p>Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for</p>
<p>you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the</p>
<p>look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share</p>
<p>and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or</p>
<p>in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the</p>
<p>collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post</p>
<p>content, including photos, comments and other materials ("<strong>User Content</strong>"), to the Service and to</p>
<p>share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of</p>
<p>your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms</p>
<p>and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at</p>
<p>http://instagram.com/legal/terms).</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</li>
</ol>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone</p>
<p>number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related</p>
<p>emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security</p>
<p>notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>Finding your friends on Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts</p>
<p>either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of</p>
<p>names and usernames on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access</p>
<p>your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using</p>
<p>Instagram.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be</p>
<p>prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that</p>
<p>such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then</p>
<p>simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p><strong>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</strong> If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our</p>
<p>"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and</p>
<p>send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible</p>
<p>for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Help Center</strong></p>
<p>Search the Help Center</p>
<p>coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These</p>
<p>tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-</p>
<p>ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this</p>
<p>analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be</p>
<p>used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,</p>
<p>and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use</p>
<p>cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>More information is available in our About Cookies section</p>
<p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to</p>
<p>access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or</p>
<p>app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including</p>
<p>your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,</p>
<p>number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,</p>
<p>pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent</p>
<p>to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by</p>
<p>recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,</p>
<p>collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device</p>
<p>identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile</p>
<p>device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in</p>
<p>connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system</p>
<p>or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and</p>
<p>use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some</p>
<p>features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired</p>
<p>or disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata</p>
<p>can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content</p>
<p>is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark</p>
<p>keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or</p>
<p>other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you</p>
<p>geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be</p>
<p>stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made</p>
<p>public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use</p>
<p>information that we receive to:</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the</p>
<p>Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or</p>
<p>other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Instagram application on your device</p>
<p>Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on</p>
<p>the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.</p>
<p>hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<ol>
<li>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which</p>
<p>Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from</p>
<p>cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally</p>
<p>part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group</p>
<p>("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service</p>
<p>(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better</p>
<p>and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can</p>
<p>see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and</p>
<p>device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to</p>
<p>you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.</p>
<p>This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted</p>
<p>advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
<p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer</p>
<p>associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p><strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong></p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User</p>
<p>Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you</p>
<p>set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you</p>
<p>have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by</p>
<p>other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to</p>
<p>the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and</p>
<p>archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied</p>
<p>or saved that information.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong></p>
<p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization</p>
<p>(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),</p>
<p>your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected</p>
<p>through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User</p>
<p>Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search</p>
<p>warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This</p>
<p>may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,</p>
<p>preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent</p>
<p>and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of</p>
<p>investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may</p>
<p>be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal</p>
<p>request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
