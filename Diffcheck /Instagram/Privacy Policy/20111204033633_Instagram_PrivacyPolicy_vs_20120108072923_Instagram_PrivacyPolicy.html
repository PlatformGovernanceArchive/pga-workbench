<p>Burbn Inc. ("Burbn") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com,</p>
<p>and burbn.com. It is Burbn’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information</p>
<p>we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<p>Website Visitors</p>
<p>Like most website operators, Burbn collects non-personally-identifying information of</p>
<p>the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser</p>
<p>type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>
<p>Burbn’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better</p>
<p>understand how Burbn’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Burbn may</p>
<p>release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a</p>
<p>report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Burbn also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol</p>
<p>(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Instagram posts.</p>
<p>Burbn only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same</p>
<p>circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as</p>
<p>described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed</p>
<p>to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Certain visitors to Burbn’s websites choose to interact with Burbn in ways that require</p>
<p>Burbn to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information</p>
<p>that Burbn gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask</p>
<p>visitors who sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and</p>
<p>email address. In each case, Burbn collects such information only insofar as is</p>
<p>necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Burbn.</p>
<p>Burbn does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described</p>
<p>below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with</p>
<p>the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p>Aggregated Statistics</p>
<p>Burbn may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Burbn may</p>
<p>display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Burbn does not</p>
<p>disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Burbn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information</p>
<p>only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to</p>
<p>know that information in order to process it on Burbn’s behalf or to provide services</p>
<p>available at Burbn’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>
<p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located</p>
<p>outside of your home country; by using Burbn’s websites, you consent to the transfer</p>
<p>of such information to them. Burbn will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying</p>
<p>and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,</p>
<p>contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Burbn discloses</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when</p>
<p>required to do so by law, or when Burbn believes in good faith that disclosure is</p>
<p>reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Burbn, third parties or the</p>
<p>public at large. If you are a registered user of a Burbn website and have supplied your</p>
<p>email address, Burbn may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new</p>
<p>features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with</p>
<p>Burbn and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate</p>
<p>this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you</p>
<p>send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback</p>
<p>mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to</p>
<p>your request or to help us support other users. Burbn takes all measures reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
