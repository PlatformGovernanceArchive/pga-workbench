<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Instagram Inc. ("Instagram") operates several websites including instagr.am, instagram.com, and Instagram.com. It is Instagram's policy to respect</p>
<p>your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>
<p>Like most website operators, Instagram collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make</p>
<p>available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Instagram's purpose in</p>
<p>collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Instagram's visitors use its website. From time to time, Instagram may</p>
<p>release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Instagram also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving</p>
<p>comments on Instagram posts. Instagram only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and</p>
<p>discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the</p>
<p>administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p>Certain visitors to Instagram's websites choose to interact with Instagram in ways that require Instagram to gather personally-identifying</p>
<p>information. The amount and type of information that Instagram gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who</p>
<p>sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, Instagram collects such information only</p>
<p>insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Instagram. Instagram does not disclose personally-</p>
<p>identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat</p>
<p>that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>
<p>Instagram may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Instagram may display this information publicly or provide it to others.</p>
<p>However, Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p>Instagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated</p>
<p>organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instagram's behalf or to provide services available at Instagram's</p>
<p>websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located</p>
<p>outside of your home country; by using Instagram's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Instagram will not rent or sell</p>
<p>potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated</p>
<p>organizations, as described above, Instagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required</p>
<p>to do so by law, or when Instagram believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instagram,</p>
<p>third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Instagram website and have supplied your email address, Instagram may</p>
<p>occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with</p>
<p>Instagram and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type</p>
<p>of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to</p>
<p>publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Instagram takes all measures reasonably</p>
<p>necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>preferences. Instagram visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before</p>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server</p>
<p>to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.</p>
<p>This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This</p>
<p>Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Instagram and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
