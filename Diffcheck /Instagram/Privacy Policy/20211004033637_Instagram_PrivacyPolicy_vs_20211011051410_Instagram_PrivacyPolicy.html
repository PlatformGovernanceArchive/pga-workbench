<p><strong>Data Policy</strong></p>
<p>This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and other products and</p>
<p>features offered by Facebook (Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and information in the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect depend on</p>
<p>how you use our Products. You can learn how to access and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings</p>
<p>and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content, communications and other information you</p>
<p>provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and</p>
<p>message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like</p>
<p>metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see</p>
<p>through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest masks and filters that you</p>
<p>might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and</p>
<p>communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described</p>
<p>below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Facebook profile fields or</p>
<p>Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This</p>
<p>and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership)</p>
<p>could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and</p>
<p>groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to</p>
<p>upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we</p>
<p>use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view</p>
<p>or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the</p>
<p>time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our</p>
<p>Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information</p>
<p>about how you use features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our Products for purchases or other</p>
<p>financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect</p>
<p>information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit</p>
<p>card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping</p>
<p>and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also receive and analyze content,</p>
<p>communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include</p>
<p>information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you, or</p>
<p>upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-</p>
<p>connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different</p>
<p>devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better</p>
<p>personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as</p>
<p>your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone</p>
<p>on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level,</p>
<p>signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as whether</p>
<p>a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from</p>
<p>bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you</p>
<p>use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell</p>
<p>towers.</p>
<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as</p>
<p>access to your GPS location, camera or photos.</p>
<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time</p>
<p>zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone</p>
<p>to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about</p>
<p>how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through Facebook Business Tools they use,</p>
<p>including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook</p>
<p>pixel. These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—including information about your</p>
<p>device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not</p>
<p>you have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to</p>
<p>tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive</p>
<p>information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights</p>
<p>to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require</p>
<p>each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>
<p>Learn more about the types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook Business Tools, review the Facebook</p>
<p>Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Facebook</p>
<p>Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including</p>
<p>your News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or</p>
<p>events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized</p>
<p>Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based</p>
<p>on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to</p>
<p>provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and</p>
<p>interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to personalize your</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram experience, including features, content and recommendations in Facebook Products;</p>
<p>you can also learn more about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on</p>
<p>different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on</p>
<p>Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also</p>
<p>make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information</p>
<p>(such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as your current location, where</p>
<p>you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and</p>
<p>improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things</p>
<p>like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and</p>
<p>others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our</p>
<p>Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos,</p>
<p>videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special</p>
<p>protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or</p>
<p>control our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether we use this technology</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information about</p>
<p>your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content</p>
<p>that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we</p>
<p>use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you</p>
<p>see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,</p>
<p>and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and</p>
<p>services. Learn how we share information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam</p>
<p>and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of</p>
<p>Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms</p>
<p>or policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and</p>
<p>Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our</p>
<p>Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you</p>
<p>contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support</p>
<p>research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and</p>
<p>well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief</p>
<p>efforts. Learn more about our research programs.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example,</p>
<p>when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or</p>
<p>a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or</p>
<p>businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you</p>
<p>have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts</p>
<p>see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This</p>
<p>includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public</p>
<p>profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public</p>
<p>forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide</p>
<p>access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or</p>
<p>downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by</p>
<p>apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can</p>
<p>choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you</p>
<p>shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can</p>
<p>download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality</p>
<p>experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their</p>
<p>content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can</p>
<p>change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For</p>
<p>example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you</p>
<p>on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you</p>
<p>are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products,</p>
<p>they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can</p>
<p>receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website</p>
<p>on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on</p>
<p>Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of</p>
<p>Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers</p>
<p>(although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information</p>
<p>collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not</p>
<p>developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For</em></p>
<p><em>example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</em></p>
<p><em>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can</em></p>
<p><em>request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.</em></p>
<p><em>Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to</p>
<p>the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business</p>
<p>Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to</p>
<p>people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we</p>
<p>share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are</p>
<p>engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or</p>
<p>accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other</p>
<p>information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing,</p>
<p>but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that</p>
<p>by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a</p>
<p>woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action</p>
<p>with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to</p>
<p>our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content</p>
<p>creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by</p>
<p>providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances</p>
<p>scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics</p>
<p>of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in</p>
<p>the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted</p>
<p>by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp</p>
<p>about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such</p>
<p>as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and</p>
<p>Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted -</p>
<p>whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is</p>
<p>collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on</p>
<p>Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is</p>
<p>deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that</p>
<p>copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data</p>
<p>obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be</p>
<p>able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be</p>
<p>deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your</p>
<p>account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is</p>
<p>consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the</p>
<p>Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or</p>
<p>imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be</p>
<p>accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental</p>
<p>investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those</p>
<p>you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred</p>
<p>or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as</p>
<p>described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and</p>
<p>Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the</p>
<p>European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data</p>
<p>transfers to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you</p>
<p>choose to continue using our Products.</p>
<p><strong>IX. How to contact Facebook with questions</strong></p>
