In<span style="background-color: green;">stagram, Messenger and other products and features offered by Facebook

(Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and

information in the Facebook</span> Se<span style="background-color: red;">p</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">embe</span><span style="background-color: green;">tings and Instag</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">am Settings.

I. What kinds of information do we

collect?

To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of

information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access

and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram

Settings.

**Things you and others do and provide**

**Information and content you provide.** We collect the content,

communications and other information you provide when you use our

Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content,

and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or

about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo

or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through

features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest

masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera

formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you

and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes

described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the

things you share.

Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in

your Facebook profile fields or Life Events about your religious views,

political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other

information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade

union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws

of your country.

**Networks and connections.** We collect information about the people,

Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you

interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with

the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you

choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book

or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and

others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.

**Your usage.** We collect information about how you use our Products, such

as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the

How can we help?

**Help Center**

actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time,

frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're

using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other

content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you

use features like our camera.

**Information about transactions made on our Products.** If you use our

Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you

make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information

about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such

as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account

and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.

**Things others do and information they provide about you.** We also

receive and analyze content, communications and information that other

people provide when they use our Products. This can include information

about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a

message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.

**Device Information**

As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,

phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that

integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different

devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of

our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or

features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your

laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad

we showed you on your phone on a different device. 

Information we obtain from these devices includes: 

**Device attributes:** information such as the operating system, hardware and

software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space,

browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.

**Device operations:** information about operations and behaviors performed

on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded,

or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).

**Identifiers:** unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from

games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers

unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the same device or

account).

**Device signals:** Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi

access points, beacons, and cell towers.

**Data from device settings:** information you allow us to receive through

device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or

photos.

**Network and connections:** information such as the name of your mobile

operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address,

connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that

are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a

video from your phone to your TV.

**Cookie data:** data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs

and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Facebook

Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.

**Information from partners**

Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through

Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the

Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel.

These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—

including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you

make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you

have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game

developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could

tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information

about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data

providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third

parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights

to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more

about the types of partners we receive data from. 

To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook

Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies

Policy.

II. How do we use this information?

We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to

provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the

Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:

**Provide, personalize and improve our Products.**

We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to

personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,

Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or

events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our

Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you,

we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the

data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special

protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products;

and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and

off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to

personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,

content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more

about how we choose the ads that you see.

**Information across Facebook Products and devices:** We connect

information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices

to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook

Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that

you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or

communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience

more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration

information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when

you sign up for an account on a different Product.

**Location-related information:** We use location-related information-such as

your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the

businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our

Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can

be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect

it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Facebook

Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).

**Product research and development:** We use the information we have to

develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and

research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.

**Face recognition:** If you have it turned on, we use face recognition

technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The

face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special

protections under the laws of your country. Learn more about how we use

face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook

Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram

experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether

we use this technology for you.

**Ads and other sponsored content:** We use the information we have about

you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to

select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show

you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices

over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the

Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

**Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.**

We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such

as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other

partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services,

and understand the types of people who use their services and how people

interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share

information with these partners.

**Promote safety, integrity and security.**

We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful

conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the

integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of

Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate

suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when

someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center

and Instagram Security Tips.

**Communicate with you.**

We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,

communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies

and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact

us.

**Research and innovate for social good.**

We use the information we have to conduct and support research and

innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,

public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we

have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more

about our research programs.

III. How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the

audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you

select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,

or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram

to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can

see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on

our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also

let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. 

**Public information** can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if

they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any

information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile

on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram

account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other

people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send

public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook

Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public

information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through

third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as

TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 

Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on

Facebook and Instagram.

**Content others share or reshare about you**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can

see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off

our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you

shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to

specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that

content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality

experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone

else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to

anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change

the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with

the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a

Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you

in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have

shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.

**Information about your active status or presence on our Products.**

People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on

our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram,

Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.**

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use,

or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what

you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook

friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game

developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game

or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.

Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your

public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps

and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose

to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive

any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information

about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may,

of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected

by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this

one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and

Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have

access to all information you choose to share with them, including information

your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. 

*Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even*

*further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'*

*access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in*

*3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will*

*reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only*

*name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.*

*Requesting any other data will require our approval.*

**New owner.**

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,

we may transfer your information to the new owner.

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our

Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,

which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to

people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and

we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use

and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share

information with:

**Partners who use our analytics services.**

We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses

understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos

and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page

admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number

of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as

well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them

understand interactions with their Page or account.

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads

and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that

personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that

by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give

us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest

information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman

between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software

engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm

which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an

advertiser.

**Measurement partners.**

We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide

analytics and measurement reports to our partners.

**Partners offering goods and services in our Products.**

When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a

seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public

information and other information you share with them, as well as the

information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact

details.

**Vendors and service providers.**

We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who

support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,

analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating

payments or conducting surveys.

**Researchers and academics.**

We also provide information and content to research partners and academics

to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our

business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of

general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and

well-being.

**Law enforcement or legal requests**

We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in

the circumstances outlined below.

Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or

others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram

Settings.

IV. How do the Facebook Companies

work together?

Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other

Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,

relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.

We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these

purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.

For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its

service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram

or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook

Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different

Facebook Company Products.

V. How can I manage information

about me?

We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in

your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. 

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook

Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case

determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and

processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you

search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your

search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit

a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy

30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and

cookie data obtained through social plugins. 

When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and

status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that

others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't

want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can

deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the

Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

VI. How do we respond to legal

requests or prevent harm?

We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or

others:

In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have

a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal

requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief

that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction,

and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.

When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud,

unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or

illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or

others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or

imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive

information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud,

abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.

Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases

made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is

the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of

possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain

information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat

abuse or other term violations.

VII. How do we operate and transfer

data as part of our global services?

We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and

externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in

accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or

transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of

where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are

necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms

and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract

clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,

as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and

other countries.

VIII. How will we notify you of changes

to this policy?

We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to

review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.

IX. How to contact Facebook with

questions

You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram. If you have

questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below. We may resolve

disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and practices through

TrustArc. You can contact TrustArc through its website.

You can contact us online or by mail at: 

Facebook, Inc.

ATTN: Privacy Operations

1601 Willow Road

Menlo Park, CA 94025

Date of Last Revision: April 19,</span> 201<span style="background-color: red;">2, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by

teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating

with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being

able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.

We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you

understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your

Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're

looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core

features of the app that you've come to know and love.

Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected

prior to January 19, 2013, please click here.

Effective date: January 19, 2013

Welcome to Instagram ("Instagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for

you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the

look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!

Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share

and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or

in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the "**Service**"), and your choices about the

collection and use of your information.

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post

content, including photos, comments and other materials ("**User Content**"), to the Service and to

share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of

your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms

and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at

http://instagram.com/legal/terms).

Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("**Users**").

**1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect the following types of information.

**Information you provide us directly:**

Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.

Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone

number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.

User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.

Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related

emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security

notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

**Finding your friends on Instagram:**

If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts

either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of

names and usernames on Instagram.

If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access

your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using

Instagram.

If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be

prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that

such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then

simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.

**Note about "Invite Friends" feature:** If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our

"Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and

send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are

How can we help?

**Help Center**

responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this

invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or

control this communication.

**Analytics information:**

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These

tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-

ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this

analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be

used to identify any particular individual User.

**Cookies and similar technologies:**

When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons,

and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.

We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use

cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.

More information is available in our About Cookies section

**Log file information:**

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to

access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or

app is downloaded to your browser or device.

When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including

your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,

number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,

pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent

to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by

recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

**Device identifiers:**

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,

collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device

identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile

device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in

connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system

or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.

A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and

use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some

features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired

or disabled.

**Metadata:**

Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata

can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content

is formatted.

Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark

keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or

other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you

geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be

stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made

public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.

**2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use

information that we receive to:

help you efficiently access your information after you sign in

remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the

Service;

provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or

other forms of marketing

provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service

develop and test new products and features

monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns

diagnose or fix technology problems

automatically update the Instagram application on your device

Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities ("Events") on

the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e.

hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.

**3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which

Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. 

**Parties with whom we may share your information:**

We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from

cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally

part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group

("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service

(including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better

and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can

see your photos.

We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and

device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to

you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is

reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.

We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.

This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted

advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.

We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer

associated with you and share that aggregated information.

**Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:**

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User

Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you

set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you

have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.

Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by

other Users and subject to use under our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to

the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.

If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and

archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied

or saved that information.

**What happens in the event of a change of control:**

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Instagram or our assets to another organization

(e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),

your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected

through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User

Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy

Policy.

**Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:**

We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search

warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This

may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we

have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that

jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access,

preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent

and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of

investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may

be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal

request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of

our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.

**4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION**

**Storage and Processing:**

Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or

any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.

Instagram, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you,

including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries

or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws

governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer

information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same

data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to

any other country in which Instagram, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the

use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the

Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your

identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot ensure the security

of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be

accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique

password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Instagram,

at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you

connect to Instagram make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or

security measures of any other organization.

allow such persons to register for the Service. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the

age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13

have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.

**7. OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service,

including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go

from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites

or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link

on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not

responsible and do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If

you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access your User Content you do so at

your own risk.
