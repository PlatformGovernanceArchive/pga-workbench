9. How to Contact Us

10. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

**1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect the following types of information.

**Information you provide us directly:**

Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.

Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help

you or others be "found" on Instagram.

User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.

Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,

changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

**Finding your friends on Instagram:**

If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii)

third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Instagram.

If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or

not someone associated with your contact is using Instagram.

If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party

service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then simply type a name to search and we will

perform a search on our Service.

**Note about "Invite Friends" feature:** If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Invite friends" feature, you may select

a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that

you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from

your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this communication.

**Analytics information:**

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your

device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect

and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular

individual User.

**Cookies and similar technologies:**

When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information

about how you use Instagram and provide features to you.

We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by

us or the third party.

More information is available in our About Cookies section

**Log file information:**

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can

also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.

When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")

address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,

landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then

help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and

improvement of the Service.

**Device identifiers:**

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or

remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with

your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device

hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram.

A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or

others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of

device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

**Metadata:**

Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a

piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.

Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo),

geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and

more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the

photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.

**2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:

help you efficiently access your information after you sign in

remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;

provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing

provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service

develop and test new products and features

monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns

diagnose or fix technology problems

automatically update the Instagram application on your device Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or

activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag)

associated with that Event.

**3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which Instagram is a part) without your

consent, except as noted in this Policy.

**Parties with whom we may share your information:**

We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data (such as

usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.), with organizations that help us provide the Service to you

("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service

under reasonable confidentiality terms.

We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad

networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information

with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.

**Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:**

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as

controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting.

Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.

Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under

our Instagram API. The use of the Instagram API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.

If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if

other Users or third parties using the Instagram API have copied or saved that information</span>.

discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the

administrators of the blog where the comment was left</span>.

enforce our Terms of Use

protect the security or integrity of our Service

exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of</span> Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> in ways that require Instagram to gather personally-identifying

information. The amount and type of information that Instagram gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">we ask visit</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">rs who

sign </span>u<span style="background-color: red;">p fo</span>r <span style="background-color: green;">U</span><span style="background-color: red;">an account on http://in</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">tagram.com to provid</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> a use</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">name and email addre</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">s.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">In each case, Instagram c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">llects such info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mation</span> o<span style="background-color: red;">nly

Instagram does not disclose personally-

identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat

that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</span>

**<span style="background-color: green;">4. HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORM</span>A<span style="background-color: green;">TION</span><span style="background-color: red;">ggregated Statistics</span>**

<span style="background-color: red;">Instagram may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Instagram may display this information publicly or provide it to others.

However, Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

</span>**<span style="background-color: green;">Storage and </span>Pro<span style="background-color: red;">te</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">tion of C</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rtain Per</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">onally-Ident</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">fyi</span>ng<span style="background-color: green;">:</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Information</span>**

<span style="background-color: green;">Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which </span>Instagram<span style="background-color: red;"> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">contr</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ctors and affiliated</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities.

Instagram may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or

jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws

governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal

information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Instagram, a

company in the same group of companies as Instagram or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information

about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps

(such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Instagram cannot

ensure the security of any information you transmit to Instagram or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed,

disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for

controlling access to emails between you and Instagram, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media

services you connect to Instagram make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any

other </span>organiz<span style="background-color: red;">ations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instagram's behalf or to provide services available at Instagram's

websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located

outside of your home country; by using Instagram's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Instagram will not rent or sell

potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated

organizations, as described above, Instagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required

to do so by law, or when Instagram believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instagram,

third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Instagram website and have supplied your email address, Instagram may

occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with

Instagram and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type

of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to

publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Instagram takes all measures reasonably

necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying

inform</span>ation.

**<span style="background-color: green;">5. YOUR </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">ookies</span><span style="background-color: green;">HOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</span>**

<span style="background-color: red;">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the

visitor returns. Instagram uses cookies to help Instagram identify and track visitors, their usage of Instagram website, and their website access

preferences. Instagram visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before

using Instagram's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Instagram's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
