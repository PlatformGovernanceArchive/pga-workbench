website, such as the YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader" and other


applications.


B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no


control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In


addition, YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly


relieve YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.

policy of each other website that you visit.


3. YouTube Accounts


A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google Account. You may never use


another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.


You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.


You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.


B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for


the losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.


4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions


YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the


Service (such as the Embeddable Player).

C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service

approval:


the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing


Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and


is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:


uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or


artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the


advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or


any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.

the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.


Terms of Service



G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from


YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of


bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates


(and permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.


H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers,"


that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of


time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy


materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available


searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke


these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable

users of the Service with respect to their Content.


I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.

not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other


purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube and its


licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.

benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed

of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of


the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this


these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and YouTube's failure to


assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YouTube

Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your


assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR

13.1 Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit YouTube's liability for losses which may not be lawfully excluded or limited


by applicable law.


13.2 Subject to the overall provision in paragraph 13.1 above YouTube shall not be liable to you for:

regular mail, or postings on the Service.


14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or

and that those rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.


14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then


that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms


will continue to be valid and enforceable.


14.</span>5<span style="background-color: red;"> You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which YouTube is a part shall be third party


beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce</span>,<span style="background-color: red;"> and rely upon, any provision of


the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favour of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third


party beneficiary of the Terms.


14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with YouTube under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and YouTube


agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.


Notwithstanding this, you agree that YouTube shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types


of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.
