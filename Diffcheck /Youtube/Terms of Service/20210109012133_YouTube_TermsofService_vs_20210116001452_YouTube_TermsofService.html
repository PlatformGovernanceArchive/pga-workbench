<p>Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we</p>

<p>repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal</p>
<p>requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or</p>

<p>legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</p>
<p>A�liates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the</p>
<p>Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our</p>
<p>A�liates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where</p>
<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with su�cient time to export your Content</p>
<p>from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>

<p>you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using</p>
