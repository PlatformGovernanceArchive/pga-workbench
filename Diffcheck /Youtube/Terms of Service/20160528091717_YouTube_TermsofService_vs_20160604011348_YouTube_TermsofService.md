4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions


YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:


A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written


authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the


Service (such as the Embeddable Player).


B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.


C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service

D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written


approval:


the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing


Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">and </span>is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:

<span style="background-color: green;">or </span>artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the

</span>that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given<span style="background-color: red;"> period of</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">period of </span>time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to<span style="background-color: red;"> copy</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">copy </span>materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available
