<p>English Courtesy Translation</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the</p>
<p>platform (collectively, the “Service”). </p>
<p>Our Service</p>
<p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform,</p>
<p>and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and</p>
<p>small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Amongst other things, you</p>
<p>can find out about YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases. You can</p>
<p>also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or even Google Home.</p>
<p>Your Service Provider</p>
<p>The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600</p>
<p>Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to YouTube’s</p>
<p>“Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group.</p>
<p>Applicable Terms</p>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright</p>
<p>Policies (together, the "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you</p>
<p>provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your Content.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not</p>
<p>accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>
<p>Who may use the Service?</p>
<p>Age Requirements</p>
<p>You may use the Service if you are at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>Children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>Permission by Parent or Guardian</p>
<p>If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this</p>
<p>Agreement with you.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject</p>
<p>to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the Service. You can find tools and resources to</p>
<p>help you manage your family’s experience on YouTube in our Help Center and through Google’s Family Link.</p>
<p>Businesses</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm to us that you have authority to act on behalf</p>
<p>of that entity, and that entity accepts this Agreement.</p>
<p>Your Use of the Service</p>
<p>Content on the Service</p>
<p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as</p>
<p>comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software,</p>
<p>metrics, and other materials whether provided by you, YouTube or a third party (collectively, "Content”). Content may be</p>
<p>provided to the Service and distributed by our users and YouTube is a provider of hosting services for such Content. Content</p>
<p>is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. If you see any Content you believe does not comply</p>
<p>with this Agreement, such as by violating the Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.</p>
<p>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</p>
<p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a Google account. However,</p>
<p>you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to</p>
<p>channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Google account.</p>
<p>Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading videos, making</p>
<p>comments or creating playlists. Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube channel.</p>
<p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on</p>
<p>third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, including what to do if you learn of any</p>
<p>unauthorised use of your password or Google account.</p>
<p>Your Information</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service. The</p>
<p>YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.</p>
<p>We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the YouTube Data</p>
<p>Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn</p>
<p>More.</p>
<p>Permissions and Restrictions</p>
<p>You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and the law. You</p>

<p>embeddable YouTube player.</p>

<p>sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from</p>
<p>the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage</p>
<p>where YouTube videos are the only content of value)</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Reservation</p>
<p>Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective rights holders. This</p>
<p>means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you</p>
<p>access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).</p>
<p>Changes to the Service</p>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part</p>
<p>of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply</p>
<p>with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will always consider and balance the impact of such</p>
<p>changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make</p>
<p>material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when</p>
<p>we need to make such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability</p>
<p>of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements. </p>
<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>Uploading Content</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote</p>
<p>your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that</p>
<p>does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party</p>
<p>intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally</p>
<p>entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems</p>
<p>that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you</p>
<p>to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>Licence to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,</p>
<p>sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose</p>
<p>of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</p>
<p>Licence to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a</p>
<p>feature of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of Licence</p>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will</p>
<p>terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires</p>
<p>otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by</p>
<p>other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for</p>
<p>legal purposes.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before</p>
<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third</p>
<p>parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we</p>
<p>reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise</p>
<p>risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the</p>
<p>Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting</p>
<p>and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If</p>
<p>you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where</p>
<p>you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<p>Account Suspension and Termination</p>
<p>Terminations by You</p>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves</p>
<p>closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy of your data first. </p>
<p>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause</p>
<p>YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the</p>
<p>Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal</p>
<p>requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,</p>
<p>other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube reasonably</p>
<p>believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)</p>
<p>would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any</p>
<p>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where</p>
<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</p>
<p>certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such</p>
<p>use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
<p>About Software in our Service</p>
<p>Downloadable Software</p>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission</p>
<p>for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device</p>
<p>settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal,</p>
<p>worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of</p>
<p>the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
<p>YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part</p>
<p>of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these</p>
<p>restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p>Open Source</p>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence that we make available to you. There may</p>
<p>be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those</p>
<p>licenses.</p>
<p>Other Legal Terms</p>
<p>Warranty</p>
<p>We provide the Service with reasonable care and skill.</p>
<p>Disclaimer</p>
<p>By law, consumers have certain rights that cannot be excluded or altered by a contract. Nothing in this Agreement affects</p>
<p>those rights you may have as a consumer. Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as required by law, YouTube</p>

<p>the amount of revenue that YouTube has paid to you from your use of the Service in the 12 months before the date of</p>
<p>your notice, in writing to YouTube, of the claim and (b) €500, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Third-Party Links</p>

<p>you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:</p>
<p>A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,</p>
<p>in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such</p>

<p>Player and its related technologies);</p>
<p>C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website</p>
<p>itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;</p>
<p>D. you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the</p>
<p>Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or</p>
