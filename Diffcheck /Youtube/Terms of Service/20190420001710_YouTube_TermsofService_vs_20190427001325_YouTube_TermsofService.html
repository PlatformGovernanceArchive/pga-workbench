</ol>
<p>5.1 YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and</p>
<p>you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:</p>
<p>A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,</p>
<p>in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such</p>
<p>distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);</p>
<p>B. you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the YouTube</p>
<p>Player and its related technologies);</p>
<p>C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website</p>
<p>itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;</p>
<p>D. you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the</p>
<p>Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or</p>
<p>the content accessible via the Service;</p>
<p>E. you agree not to use the Service (including the YouTube Player) for any of the following commercial uses unless you</p>

<p>sufficient value to be the basis for such sales</p>
<p>F. prohibited commercial uses shall not include (i) uploading an original video to YouTube, (ii) maintaining an original</p>
<p>channel on the Website in order to promote a business or artistic enterprise, (iii) showing YouTube videos through the</p>

<p>14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or</p>
