<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>

<p>your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that</p>
<p>does not comply with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) or the law. For example, the Content</p>
<p>you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from</p>
<p>that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We</p>
<p>may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, <span style="background-color: red;">su</span><span style="background-color: green;">in</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">h</span><span style="background-color: green;">luding</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> s</span>pam<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;"> and</span> malware<span style="background-color: red;">, and</p>
<p>illegal content</span>.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of</p>
<p>the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>License to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, <span style="background-color: red;">sublicensable and</p>
<p></span>transfer<span style="background-color: green;">able,</p>
<p>sublicens</span>able license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it<span style="background-color: red;">) in</p>
<p>connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of</p>
<p>promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.</p>
<p>License to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only</p>
<p>as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds</span>).<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>YouTube may only use that Content in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates)</p>
<p>business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.</p>
<p>License to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it, only</p>
<p>as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds).</span> For clarity, this license does not grant any rights</p>
<p>or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of License</p>
<p>The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content</p>
<p>from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server</p>
<p>copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. </p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before</p>
<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third</p>
<p>parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless</p>
<p>we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would</p>
<p>otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of</p>
<p>the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about</p>
<p>reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If</p>
<p>you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where</p>
<p>you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<p>Account Suspension &amp; Termination</p>
<p>Terminations by You</p>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account,</p>
<p>which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your</p>
<p>data first.</p>
<p>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause</p>
<p>YouTube may suspend or terminate your <span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">acce</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">e of the Service</span>s, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all<span style="background-color: red;"> or part of the</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or part of the </span>Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a<span style="background-color: red;"> legal</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">legal </span>requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to<span style="background-color: red;"> any</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">any </span>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your <span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">acce</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">e of the Service</span>s, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube<span style="background-color: red;"> believes, in its</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">believes, in its </span>sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)</p>
<p>would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any</p>
<p>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.

<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</p>
<p>certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such</p>
<p>use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
<p>About Software in the Service</p>
<p>Downloadable Software</p>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission</p>
<p>for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device</p>
<p>settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal,</p>
<p>worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of</p>
<p>the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
