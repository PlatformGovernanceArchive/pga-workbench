<p>Community Guidelines</p>
<p><strong>1. Your Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>A. By using or visiting the YouTube website or any YouTube products, software, data feeds, and services provided to you</p>
<p>on, from, or through the YouTube website (collectively the "Service") you signify your agreement to (1) these terms and</p>
<p>conditions (the "Terms of Service"), (2) Google's Privacy Policy, found at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy and</p>
<p>incorporated herein by reference, and (3) YouTube's Community Guidelines, found at</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines and also incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to any</p>
<p>of these terms, the Google Privacy Policy, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the Service.</p>
<p>B. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should</p>
<p>periodically review the most up-to-date version http://www.youtube.com/t/terms). YouTube may, in its sole discretion,</p>
<p>modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or</p>
<p>revisions. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
<p><strong>2. Service</strong></p>
<p>A. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the</p>
<p>Service. “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual</p>
<p>combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.</p>
<p>The Service includes all aspects of YouTube, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via</p>
<p>the YouTube website, such as the YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader"</p>
<p>and other applications.</p>
<p>B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no</p>
<p>control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you</p>
<p>expressly relieve YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>
<p>C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and</p>
<p>privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>3. YouTube Accounts</strong></p>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google Account. You may never</p>
<p>use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete</p>
<p>information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account</p>
<p>password secure. You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable</p>
<p>for the losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<p><strong>4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the</p>
<p>Service (such as the Embeddable Player).</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service</p>
<p>itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>approval:</p>
<p>the sale of access to the Service;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing</p>
<p>Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page</p>
<p>and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business</p>
<p>or artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the</p>
<p>advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>
<p>F. If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or</p>
<p>functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time</p>
<p>from YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the</p>
<p>form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such</p>
<p>updates (and permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline</p>
<p>readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given</p>
<p>period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to</p>
<p>copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available</p>
<p>searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke</p>
<p>these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable</p>
<p>information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the</p>
<p>Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial</p>
<p>purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.</p>
<p>I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.</p>
<p>J. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.</p>
<p><strong>5. Your Use of Content</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of Content.</p>
<p>A. The Content on the Service, and the trademarks, service marks and logos ("Marks") on the Service, are owned by or</p>
<p>licensed to YouTube, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.</p>
<p>B. Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended</p>
<p>through the provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download</p>
<p>any Content unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content. You</p>
<p>shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for</p>
<p>any other purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube</p>
<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that</p>
<p>prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.</p>
<p>D. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that</p>
<p>YouTube is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such</p>
<p>Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive,</p>
<p>indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you</p>
<p>have or may have against YouTube with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to</p>
<p>indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent</p>
<p>allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>6. Your Content and Conduct</strong></p>
<p>A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including videos and user comments. You</p>
<p>understand that YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.</p>
<p>B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content</p>
<p>on the Service. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and</p>
<p>permissions to publish Content you submit; and you license to YouTube all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright</p>
<p>or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you</p>
<p>hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use,</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and</p>
<p>YouTube's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part</p>
<p>or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also</p>
<p>hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use,</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under</p>
<p>these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within</p>
<p>a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your videos from the Service. You understand and agree,</p>
<p>however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been</p>
<p>removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material</p>
<p>that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material</p>
<p>or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.</p>
<p>E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the YouTube</p>
<p>Community Guidelines, currently found at http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines, which may be updated</p>
<p>from time to time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion,</p>
<p>recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with</p>
<p>Content. YouTube does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the</p>
<p>Service, and YouTube will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual</p>
<p>property rights. YouTube reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Account Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be</p>
<p>a repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright</p>
<p>infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time,</p>
<p>without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting</p>
<p>such material in violation of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may</p>
<p>submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with</p>
<p>the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is</p>
<p>allegedly infringed;</p>
<p>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single</p>
<p>online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to</p>
<p>be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service</p>
<p>provider to locate the material;</p>
<p>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone</p>
<p>number, and, if available, an electronic mail;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not</p>
<p>authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are</p>
<p>authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>YouTube's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is Shadie Farazian, 901 Cherry</p>
<p>Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, email: copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should</p>
<p>go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications</p>
<p>should be directed to YouTube customer service through http://www.google.com/support/youtube. You acknowledge</p>
<p>that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing,</p>
<p>or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post</p>
<p>and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the</p>
<p>Copyright Agent:</p>
<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
<p>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at</p>
<p>which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or</p>
<p>a misidentification of the Content; and</p>
<p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of</p>
<p>the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the</p>
<p>person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original</p>
<p>complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business</p>
<p>days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user,</p>
<p>the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the</p>
<p>counter-notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>9. Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT</p>
<p>PERMITTED BY LAW, YOUTUBE, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL</p>

<p>OF YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE</p>
<p>SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER</p>
<p>OR NOT THE COMPANY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF</p>
<p>LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUTUBE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONTENT OR THE DEFAMATORY,</p>
<p>OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE</p>
<p>FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</p>
<p>The Service is controlled and offered by YouTube from its facilities in the United States of America. YouTube makes no</p>
<p>representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service</p>
<p>from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p>
<p><strong>11. Indemnity</strong></p>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its parent corporation,</p>
<p>officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,</p>
<p>costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the</p>
<p>Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without</p>
<p>limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party. This</p>
<p>defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>12. Ability to Accept Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian</p>
<p>consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and</p>
<p>warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you</p>
<p>affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age,</p>
<p>then please do not use the Service. There are lots of other great web sites for you. Talk to your parents about what sites are</p>
<p>appropriate for you.</p>
<p><strong>13. Assignment</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may</p>
<p>be assigned by YouTube without restriction.</p>
<p><strong>14. General</strong></p>
<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive</p>
<p>website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over YouTube, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than</p>
<p>California. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without</p>
<p>respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and YouTube that arises in whole or in part from</p>
<p>the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California. These</p>
<p>Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Notice at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy and any other legal notices published</p>
<p>by YouTube on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and YouTube concerning the Service. If any</p>
<p>provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall</p>
<p>not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No</p>
<p>waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other</p>
<p>term, and YouTube's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such</p>
<p>right or provision. YouTube reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your</p>
<p>responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Service following any amendment of these</p>
<p>Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY</p>
<p>CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR</p>
<p>AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
