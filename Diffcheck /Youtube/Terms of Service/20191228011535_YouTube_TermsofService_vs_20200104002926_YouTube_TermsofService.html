<p>Our Service</p>
<p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform,</p>
<p>and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and</p>
<p>small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Among other things, you</p>
<p>can find out about YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases (where</p>
<p>available).You can also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or Google</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<p>Your Service Provider</p>
<p>The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600</p>
<p>Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to YouTube’s</p>
<p>“Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).</p>
<p>Applicable Terms</p>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright</p>
<p>Policies which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the</p>
<p>Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in</p>
<p>your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the</p>
<p>Agreement.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not</p>
<p>accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>
<p>Who may use the Service?</p>
<p>Age Requirements</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. However, children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available)</p>
<p>if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.</p>

<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject</p>
<p>to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the Service. You can find tools and resources to</p>

<p>that entity, and that such entity accepts this Agreement.</p>

<p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as</p>
<p>comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software,</p>
<p>metrics, and other materials whether provided by you, YouTube or a third-party (collectively, "Content”).</p>
<p>Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. YouTube is under no obligation to host or</p>
<p>serve Content. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with this Agreement, including by violating the</p>
<p>Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.</p>
<p>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</p>
<p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a Google account. However,</p>
<p>you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to</p>
<p>channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Google account.</p>
<p>Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading videos, making</p>
<p>comments or creating playlists (where available). Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube channel.</p>
<p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on</p>
<p>third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, including what to do if you learn of any</p>
<p>unauthorised use of your password or Google account.</p>

<p>YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.</p>

<p>Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn</p>

<p>Reservation</p>
<p>Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other</p>
<p>Content posted by others or YouTube.</p>
<p>Changes to the Service</p>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part</p>
<p>of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply</p>
<p>with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an</p>
<p>individual user. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make material changes to our</p>
<p>Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, you understand and agree that there will be</p>
<p>times when we make such changes without notice, such as where we feel we need to take action to improve the security and</p>
<p>operability of our Service, prevent abuse, or comply with legal requirements. </p>
<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>Uploading Content</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote</p>
<p>your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that</p>
<p>does not comply with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) or the law. For example, the Content</p>
<p>you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from</p>
<p>that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We</p>
<p>may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and</p>
<p>illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of</p>
<p>the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>License to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and</p>
<p>transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in</p>
<p>connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of</p>
<p>promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.</p>
<p>License to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only</p>
<p>as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights</p>
<p>or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of License</p>
<p>The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content</p>
<p>from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server</p>
<p>copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. </p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before</p>
<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third</p>
<p>parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless</p>
<p>we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would</p>
<p>otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of</p>
<p>the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about</p>
<p>reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If</p>
<p>you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where</p>
<p>you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>

<p>which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your</p>
<p>data first.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any</p>
<p>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service </span>C<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">re</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">tors &amp; Part</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>s</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">YouTube</span> <span style="background-color: green;">may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its</p>
<p>sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)</p>
<p>would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</span></p>
<p>A<span style="background-color: green;">ff</span><span style="background-color: red;">dvert</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">l</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ng</p>

<p>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where</p>
<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</p>
<p>certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such</p>
<p>use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
<p>About Software in the Service</span></p>
<p>D<span style="background-color: red;">evel</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">wnloadabl</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rs</p>
<p></span> <span style="background-color: green;">Software</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission</p>
<p>for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device</p>
<p>settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal,</p>
<p>worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of</p>
<p>the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
<p>YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part</p>
<p>of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these</p>
<p>restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p>Open Source</p>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may</p>
<p>be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those</p>
<p>licenses. </p>

<p>Affiliates. To ensure you understand exactly who we mean when we talk about our group companies, we’ve</p>
<p>included a definition of our “Affiliates”, meaning the companies in the Alphabet corporate group.</p>

<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>This section applies to users who provide Content to the Service. It defines the scope of the permissions that you grant</p>

<p>better reflect applicable consumer rights law in your country.</p>
<p>Business Users. Our Terms now distinguish “Business Users” from consumers, for the purposes of our limitation of</p>
<p>liability, following the definition set out by law. If you would like some more detail about the distinction between a</p>
<p>consumer and a Business User, please have a look at our FAQ.</p>

<p>Welcome to YouTube!</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the</p>
<p>platform (collectively, the “Service”). </p>
<p>Our Service</p>
<p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform,</p>
<p>and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and</p>
<p>small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Amongst other things, you</p>
<p>can find out about YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases. You can</p>
<p>also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or even Google Home.</p>
<p>Your Service Provider</p>
<p>The entity providing the Service in the European Economic Area, and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, a company</p>
<p>incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland, (Registered Number: 368047), located at Gordon House, Barrow Street,</p>
<p>Dublin 4, Ireland (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means</p>
<p>the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group.</p>
<p>Applicable Terms</p>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright</p>
<p>Policies (together, the "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you</p>
<p>provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your Content.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not</p>
<p>accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>
<p>Who may use the Service?</p>
<p>Age Requirements</p>
<p>You may use the Service if you are at least 13 years old.</p>
<p>Children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>Permission by Parent or Guardian</p>
<p>If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this</p>
<p>Agreement with you.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject</p>
<p>to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the Service. You can find tools and resources to</p>
<p>help you manage your family’s experience on YouTube in our Help Center and through Google’s Family Link.</p>
<p>Businesses</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm to us that you have authority to act on behalf</p>
<p>of that entity, and that entity accepts this Agreement.</p>
<p>Your Use of the Service</p>
<p>Content on the Service</p>
<p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as</p>
<p>comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software,</p>
<p>metrics, and other materials (collectively, "Content”). Content may be provided to the Service and distributed by our users</p>
<p>and YouTube is a provider of hosting services for such Content. Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that</p>
<p>provides it to the Service. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with these terms, such as by violating the</p>
<p>Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.</p>
<p>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</p>
<p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a Google account. However,</p>
<p>you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to</p>
<p>channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Google account.</p>
<p>Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading videos, making</p>
<p>comments or creating playlists. Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube channel.</p>
<p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on</p>
<p>third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, including what to do if you learn of any</p>
<p>unauthorised use of your password or Google account.</p>
<p>Your Information</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service. The</p>
<p>YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.</p>
<p>We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the YouTube Data</p>
<p>Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn</p>
<p>More.</p>
<p>Permissions and Restrictions</p>
<p>You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and the law. You</p>

<p>permitted by applicable law;</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or</p>
<ol>
<li>use the Service to: (a) sell any advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on, around, or within the Service or</li>
</ol>
<p>Content, other than those allowed in the Advertising on YouTube policies (such as compliant product placements); or (b)</p>
<p>sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from</p>
<p>the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage</p>
<p>where YouTube videos are the only content of value).</p>
<p>Reservation</p>
<p>Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective rights holders. This</p>
<p>means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you</p>
<p>access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).</p>
<p>Changes to the Service</p>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part</p>
<p>of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply</p>
<p>with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will always consider and balance the impact of such</p>
<p>changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make</p>
<p>material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when</p>
<p>we need to make such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability</p>
<p>of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements. </p>
<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>Uploading Content</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote</p>
<p>your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that</p>
<p>does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party</p>
<p>intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally</p>
<p>entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems</p>
<p>that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you</p>
<p>to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>Licence to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,</p>
<p>sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose</p>
<p>of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</p>
<p>Licence to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a</p>
<p>feature of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of Licence</p>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will</p>
<p>terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires</p>
<p>otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by</p>
<p>other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for</p>
<p>legal purposes.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before</p>
<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third</p>
<p>parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we</p>
<p>reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise</p>
<p>risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the</p>
<p>Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting</p>
<p>and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If</p>
<p>you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where</p>
<p>you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<p>Account Suspension and Termination</p>
<p>Terminations by You</p>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves</p>
<p>closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy of your data first. </p>
<p>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause</p>
<p>YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the</p>
<p>Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal</p>
<p>requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,</p>
<p>other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube reasonably</p>
<p>believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)</p>
<p>would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any</p>
<p>user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service Changes, where</p>
<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</p>
<p>certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such</p>
<p>use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
<p>About Software in our Service</p>
<p>Downloadable Software</p>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission</p>
<p>for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device</p>
<p>settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal,</p>
<p>worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of</p>
<p>the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
<p>YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part</p>
<p>of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these</p>
<p>restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p>Open Source</p>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence. There may be provisions in an open source</p>
<p>licence that expressly override some of these terms. If so, we will make that open source licence available to you.</p>
<p>Other Legal Terms</p>
<p>Warranty</p>
