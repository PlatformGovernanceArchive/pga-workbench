<p>does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party</p>
<p>intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally</p>
<p>entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems</p>
<p>that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you</p>
<p>to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>Licence to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,</p>
<p>sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose</p>
<p>of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</p>
<p>Licence to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a</p>
<p>feature of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of Licence</p>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will</p>
<p>terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires</p>
<p>otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by</p>
<p>other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for</p>
<p>legal purposes.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>

<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>

<p>parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we</p>
<p>reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise</p>
<p>risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the</p>
<p>Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting</p>
