<ol>
<li>Service</li>
</ol>
<p>A. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the</p>
<p>Service. “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual</p>
<p>combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.</p>
<p>The Service includes all aspects of YouTube, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via</p>
<p>the YouTube website, such as the YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader"</p>
<p>and other applications.</p>
<p>B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no</p>
<p>control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you</p>
<p>expressly relieve YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>
<p>C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and</p>
<p>privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<ol>
<li>YouTube Accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google Account. You may never</p>
<p>use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete</p>
<p>information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account</p>
<p>password secure. You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable</p>
<p>for the losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<ol>
<li>General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</li>
</ol>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the</p>
<p>Service (such as the Embeddable Player).</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service</p>
<p>itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>approval:</p>
<p>the sale of access to the Service;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing</p>
<p>Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page</p>
<p>and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business</p>
<p>or artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the</p>
<p>advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>
<p>F. If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or</p>
<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time</p>
<p>from YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the</p>
<p>form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such</p>
<p>updates (and permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline</p>
<p>readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given</p>
<p>period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to</p>
<p>copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available</p>
<p>searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke</p>
<p>these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable</p>
<p>information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the</p>
<p>Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial</p>
<p>purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.</p>
<p>I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.</p>
<p>J. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Use of Content</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of Content.</p>
<p>A. The Content on the Service, and the trademarks, service marks and logos ("Marks") on the Service, are owned by or</p>
<p>licensed to YouTube, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.</p>
<p>B. Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended</p>
<p>through the provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download</p>
<p>any Content unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content. You</p>
<p>shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for</p>
<p>any other purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube</p>
<p>and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that</p>
<p>prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.</p>
<p>D. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that</p>
<p>YouTube is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such</p>
<p>Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive,</p>
<p>indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you</p>
<p>have or may have against YouTube with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to</p>
<p>indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent</p>
<p>allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Content and Conduct</li>
</ol>
<p>A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including videos and user comments. You</p>
<p>understand that YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.</p>
<p>B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content</p>
<p>on the Service. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and</p>
<p>permissions to publish Content you submit; and you license to YouTube all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright</p>
<p>or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you</p>
<p>hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use,</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and</p>
<p>YouTube's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part</p>
<p>or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also</p>
<p>hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use,</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under</p>
<p>these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within</p>
<p>a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your videos from the Service. You understand and agree,</p>
<p>however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been</p>
<p>removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material</p>
<p>that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material</p>
<p>or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.</p>
<p>E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the YouTube</p>
<p>Community Guidelines, currently found at https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines, which may be updated</p>
<p>from time to time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>F. YouTube will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the YouTube</p>
<p>Data Processing Terms (www.youtube.com/t/terms_dataprocessing), except in cases where you uploaded such</p>
<p>content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn more here: support.google.com/youtube/?</p>
<p>p=data_applicability.</p>
<p>G. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion,</p>
<p>recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with</p>
<p>Content. YouTube does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the</p>
<p>Service, and YouTube will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual</p>
<p>property rights. YouTube reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Account Termination Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be</p>
<p>a repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright</p>
<p>infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time,</p>
<p>without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting</p>
<p>such material in violation of these Terms of Service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</li>
</ol>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may</p>
<p>submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with</p>
<p>the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>

<p>online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>

<p>Terms.</p>

<li>Changes to the Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to make changes the Terms from time to time, for example to address changes to the law or</p>
<p>regulatory changes or changes to functionality offered through the Service. Therefore you must look at the Terms regularly to</p>
<p>check for such changes. The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") will be posted at</p>
<p>https</span>:<span style="background-color: green;">//www.youtube.co.zw/t/terms</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or made available within the Service (for any modified additional terms). If you do not</p>
<p>agree to the Modified Terms you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the date the Modified</p>
<p>Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of the Modified Terms.</p>
<ol>
<li>YouTube accounts</li>
</ol>

<li>General restrictions on use</li>
</ol>
<p>5.1 YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and</p>
<p>you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:</p>
<p>A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,</p>
<p>in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such</p>
<p>distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);</p>
<p>B. you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the YouTube</p>
<p>Player and its related technologies);</p>
<p>C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website</p>
<p>itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;</p>
<p>D. you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the</p>
<p>Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or</p>
<p>the content accessible via the Service;</p>
<p>E. you agree not to use the Service (including the YouTube Player) for any of the following commercial uses unless you</p>
<p>obtain YouTube's prior written approval:</p>
<p>i. the sale of access to the Service</p>
<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>ii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions placed on or within the Service, or Content;</p>
<p>iii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content</p>
<p>delivered via the Service unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of</p>
<p>sufficient value to be the basis for such sales</p>
<p>F. prohibited commercial uses shall not include (i) uploading an original video to YouTube, (ii) maintaining an original</p>
<p>channel on the Website in order to promote a business or artistic enterprise, (iii) showing YouTube videos through the</p>
<p>YouTube Player or otherwise on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to those advertising restrictions set out in</p>
<p>5.1(E)(iii) above; and (iv) any use that is expressly authorised by YouTube in writing;</p>
<p>G. if you use the YouTube Player on your website may not modify, build upon or block any portion or functionality of the</p>
<p>YouTube Player including but not limited to links back to the Website;</p>
<p>H. you agree not to use or launch any automated system (including, without limitation, any robot, spider or offline reader)</p>
<p>that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of</p>
<p>time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a publicly available, standard (i.e. not</p>
<p>modified) web browser;</p>
<p>I. you agree not to collect or harvest any personal data of any user of the Website or any Service (and agree that this</p>
<p>shall be deemed to include YouTube account names);</p>

<p>solicitation of business in the course of trade or in connection with a commercial enterprise;</p>

<p>L. you agree not to access Content or any reason other than your personal, non-commercial use solely as intended</p>
<p>through and permitted by the normal functionality of the Service, and solely for Streaming. "Streaming" means a</p>
<p>contemporaneous digital transmission of the material by YouTube via the Internet to a user operated Internet enabled</p>
<p>device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be downloaded (either</p>
<p>permanently or temporarily), copied, stored, or redistributed by the user.</p>
<p>M. You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content</p>

<p>sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.</p>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.</p>
<p>5.4 YouTube is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and</p>
<p>agree that the form and nature of the Service which YouTube provides may change from time to time without prior notice to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>5.5 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that YouTube may stop (permanently or temporarily)</p>
<p>providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at YouTube's sole discretion, without</p>
<p>prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you</p>

<p>completely replace any prior agreements between you and YouTube in relation to the Service. All other terms of service that</p>

<p>14.2 You agree that YouTube may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,</p>
<p>regular mail, or postings on the Service.</p>
<p>14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or</p>
<p>which YouTube has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of YouTube's rights</p>
<p>and that those rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.</p>
<p>14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then</p>
<p>that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms</p>
<p>will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>14.5 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which YouTube is a part shall be third party</p>

<p>party beneficiary of the Terms.</p>
<p>14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with YouTube under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and YouTube</p>
<p>agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, you agree that YouTube shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types</p>

<p>effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any</p>
