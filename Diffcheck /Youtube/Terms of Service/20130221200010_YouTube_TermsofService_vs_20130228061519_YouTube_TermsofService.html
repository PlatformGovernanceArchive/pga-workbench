<p>YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader" and other applications.</p>
<p>B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control</p>
<p>over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition,</p>
<p>YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve</p>
<p>YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>
<p>C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy</p>
<p>policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>3. YouTube Accounts</strong></p>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google account. You may never use</p>
<p>another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.</p>
<p>You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for</p>
<p>the losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<p><strong>4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service</p>
<p>(such as the Embeddable Player).</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself,</p>
<p>the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:</p>
<p>the sale of access to the Service;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content</p>
<p>delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of</p>
<p>sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising</p>
<p>restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>

<p>the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from</p>
<p>YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug</p>
<p>fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and</p>
<p>permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers,"</p>
<p>that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time</p>
<p>than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site</p>
<p>for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,</p>
<p>but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in</p>
<p>specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the</p>
<p>Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial</p>

<p>YouTube with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless</p>

<p>successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and</p>
<p>derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the</p>

<p>perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above</p>
<p>licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after</p>
<p>you remove or delete your videos from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not</p>
<p>display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by</p>
<p>you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is</p>

<p>time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion,</p>
<p>recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with</p>
<p>Content. YouTube does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service,</p>
<p>and YouTube will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Account Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a</p>
<p>repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright</p>
<p>infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without</p>
<p>prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in</p>
<p>violation of these Terms of Service.</p>
