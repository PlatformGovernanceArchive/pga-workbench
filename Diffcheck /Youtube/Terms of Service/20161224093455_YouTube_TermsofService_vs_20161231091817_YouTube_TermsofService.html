<p>policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<ol>
<li>YouTube Accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google Account. You may never use</p>
<p>another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.</p>
<p>You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for</p>

<ol>
<li>General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions</li>
</ol>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the</p>
<p>Service (such as the Embeddable Player).</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service</p>
<p>itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written</p>
<p>approval:</p>
<p>the sale of access to the Service;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing</p>
<p>Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and</p>
<p>is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the</p>
<p>advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>

<p>the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.</p>
<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from</p>
<p>YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of</p>
<p>bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates</p>
<p>(and permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers,"</p>
<p>that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of</p>
<p>time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy</p>
<p>materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available</p>
<p>searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke</p>
<p>these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable</p>
<p>information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service</p>
<p>(e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any</p>
<p>users of the Service with respect to their Content.</p>
<p>I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.</p>
<p>J. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.</p>
<ol>

<p>A. The Content on the Service, and the trademarks, service marks and logos ("Marks") on the Service, are owned by or</p>
<p>licensed to YouTube, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.</p>
<p>B. Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended</p>
<p>through the provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download</p>
<p>any Content unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content. You shall</p>
<p>not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other</p>
<p>purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube and its</p>
<p>licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that</p>
<p>prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.</p>
<p>D. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that YouTube</p>
<p>is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You</p>
<p>further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or</p>
<p>objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have</p>
<p>against YouTube with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold</p>
<p>harmless YouTube, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding</p>
<p>all matters related to your use of the Service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Content and Conduct</li>
</ol>
<p>A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including videos and user comments. You</p>
<p>understand that YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.</p>
<p>B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content on</p>
<p>the Service. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and</p>
<p>permissions to publish Content you submit; and you license to YouTube all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or</p>
<p>other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you hereby</p>
<p>grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce,</p>
<p>distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and YouTube's</p>
<p>(and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the</p>
<p>Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each</p>
<p>user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute,</p>
<p>display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>The above licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable</p>
<p>time after you remove or delete your videos from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may</p>
<p>retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. The above</p>
<p>licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is</p>
<p>subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are</p>
<p>otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.</p>
<p>E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the YouTube</p>
