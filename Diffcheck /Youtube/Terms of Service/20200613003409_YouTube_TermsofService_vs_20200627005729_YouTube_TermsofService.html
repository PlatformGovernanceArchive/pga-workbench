<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>Uploading Content</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote</p>
<p>your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that</p>
<p>does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party</p>
<p>intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally</p>
<p>entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems</p>
<p>that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of</p>
<p>the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>License to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,</p>
<p>sublicensable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it). YouTube may</p>
<p>only use that license in order to operate, promote and improve the Service. For clarity, nothing in these Terms is intended to</p>
<p>grant YouTube a wider scope of license than that permitted by law.</p>
<p>License to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through</p>
<p>the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a</p>
<p>feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions</p>
<p>for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of License</p>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will</p>
<p>terminate, with the only exceptions being where the Service operation, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the</p>
<p>law otherwise requires. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to (a) recall promotional materials</p>
<p>that include your Content, (b) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of</p>
<p>the Service (for example, as may be made available within a subscription offering), or (c) delete copies we reasonably need to</p>
<p>keep for legal purposes.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before</p>
<p>removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third</p>
<p>parties, we may remove or take down that Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action without delay unless we</p>
<p>reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would be prohibited due to legal reasons; or (b) could cause harm to any user, other third</p>
<p>party, YouTube or our Affiliates (for example, but not limiting to, in cases where this notification would violate the law or a</p>
<p>legal enforcement authority’s directive, compromise an investigation, or compromise the security of any Services). You can</p>
<p>learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If</p>
<p>you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where</p>
<p>you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<p>Account Suspension &amp; Termination</p>
<p>Terminations by You</p>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account,</p>
<p>which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your</p>
<p>data first.</p>
<p>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause</p>
<p>YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the</p>
<p>Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal</p>
<p>requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,</p>
<p>other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes that</p>
<p>provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube without delay unless we reasonably believe that</p>
<p>to do so: (a) would be prohibited due to legal reasons; or (b) could cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates (for example, but not limiting to, in cases where this notification would violate the law or a legal enforcement</p>
<p>authority’s directive, compromise an investigation, or compromise the security of any Services). Where YouTube is</p>
<p>terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export</p>
<p></span>your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</p>
<p>certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such</p>
<p>use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
<p>About Software in the Service</p>
<p>Downloadable Software</p>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission</p>
<p>for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device</p>
<p>settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal,</p>
<p>worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of</p>
<p>the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
<p>YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part</p>
<p>of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these</p>
<p>restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p>Open Source</p>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may</p>
<p>be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those</p>
<p>licenses. </p>

<p>We may modify this Agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.</p>
<p>YouTube will provide no less than thirty (30) days advance notice of any material modifications to this Agreement and the</p>
<p>opportunity to review them, except that modifications addressing newly available features of the Service that are favorable to</p>
<p>users or modifications made for legal reasons may be effective immediately, without notice. Modifications to this Agreement</p>
<p>will only apply going forward. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should remove any Content you have uploaded</p>
<p>and discontinue your use of the Service.</span></p>
<p>Continuation of this Agreement</p>
<p>If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “Other Legal Terms”,</p>
<p>“About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue as described under “Duration of License”.</p>
<p>Severance</p>
<p>If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">No </span>Waiver</p>
<p>If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any</p>
<p>rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>In these <span style="background-color: red;">T</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>erms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative</p>
<p>purposes.</p>

<p>arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to</p>
<p>the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will</p>
<p>apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services</p>
<p></span>will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA<span style="background-color: green;">.</span><span style="background-color: red;">, and you and</span> You<span style="background-color: red;">Tube</span><span style="background-color: green;"> and</span></p>
