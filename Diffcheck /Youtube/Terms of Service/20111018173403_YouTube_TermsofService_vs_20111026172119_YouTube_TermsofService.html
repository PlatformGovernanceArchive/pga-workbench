<p>unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Servic</span>e (<span style="background-color: green;">su</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ollectively t</span>h<span style="background-color: green;"> as th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Embeddable Player).</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself,</p>
<p>the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:</p>
<p>the sale of access to the Service;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content</p>
<p>delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient</p>
<p>value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising</p>
<p>restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>

<p>permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H.

<p>than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for</p>
<p>the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but</p>
<p>not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific</p>

</ol>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a</p>

<p>Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your</p>
<p>use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised</p>
