<p></span>Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>bound by such modifications or revisions. Nothing in this<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition,</p>
<p>YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Website, you expressly relieve</p>
<p>YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>

<p>privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>3. YouTube Accounts</strong></p>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Website, you will have to create a YouTube account. You may never use another's</p>
<p>account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely</p>
<p>responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify</p>
<p>YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the</p>
<p>losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<p><strong>4. General Use of the Website—Permissions and Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Website as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Website, including but not limited to User Submissions (defined</p>
<p>below), without YouTube's prior written authorization.</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website, including but not limited to YouTube's Embeddable Player or any of</p>
<p>its related technologies.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access User Submissions (defined below) or YouTube Content through any technology or means other</p>
<p>than the video playback pages of the Website itself, the YouTube Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means</p>
<p>YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Website, including the YouTube Embeddable Player for any commercial use, without the prior</p>
<p>written authorization of YouTube. Prohibited commercial uses include any of the following actions taken without YouTube's</p>
<p>express approval:</p>
<p>sale of access to the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable Player) on another website;</p>
<p>use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable Player), for the primary purpose of gaining</p>
<p>advertising or subscription revenue;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, on the YouTube website or any third-party website, targeted to the content of specific User</p>
<p>Submissions or YouTube content;</p>
<p>and any use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable player) that YouTube finds, in its sole</p>
<p>discretion, to use YouTube's resources or User Submissions with the effect of competing with or displacing the market</p>
<p>for YouTube, YouTube content, or its User Submissions. (For more information about prohibited commercial uses, see</p>
<p>our FAQ.)</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>
<p>using the Embeddable Player to show YouTube videos on an ad-enabled blog or website, provided the primary purpose</p>
<p>of using the Embeddable Player is not to gain advertising revenue or compete with YouTube;</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>
<p>F. If you use the YouTube Embeddable Player on your website, you must include a prominent link back to the YouTube website</p>
<p>on the pages containing the Embeddable Player and you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion of the Embeddable</p>
<p>Player in any way.</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from</p>
<p>YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug</p>
<p>fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit</p>
<p>YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers,"</p>
<p>that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time</p>
<p>than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for</p>
<p>the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not</p>
<p>caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific</p>
<p>cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Website,</p>
<p>nor to use the communication systems provided by the Website (e.g. comments, email) for any commercial solicitation</p>
<p>purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Website with respect to their User Submissions.</p>
<p>I. In your use of the website, you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, YouTube</p>
<p>Community Guidelines, and all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>J. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the YouTube Website at any time.</p>
<p><strong>5. Your Use of Content on the Site</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of content on</p>
<p>the YouTube Website.</p>
<p>A. The content on the YouTube Website, except all User Submissions (as defined below), including without limitation, the text,</p>
<p>software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, interactive features and the like ("Content") and the trademarks,</p>
<p>service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to YouTube, subject to copyright and other</p>
<p>intellectual property rights under the law. Content on the Website is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use</p>
<p>only and may not be downloaded, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, or</p>
<p>otherwise exploited for any other purposes whatsoever without the prior written consent of the respective owners. YouTube</p>
<p>reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Website and the Content.</p>
<p>B. You may access User Submissions solely:</p>
<p>for your information and personal use;</p>
<p>as intended through the normal functionality of the YouTube Service; and</p>
<p>for Streaming.</p>
<p>"Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the YouTube Service</p>
<p>to a user's device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored,</p>
<p>permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the user. Accessing User Videos for any purpose or in any manner other than</p>
<p>Streaming is expressly prohibited. User Videos are made available "as is."</p>
<p>C. User Comments are made available to you for your information and personal use solely as intended through the normal</p>
<p>functionality of the YouTube Service. User Comments are made available "as is", and may not be used, copied, reproduced,</p>
<p>distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, downloaded, or otherwise exploited in any manner not intended</p>
<p>by the normal functionality of the YouTube Service or otherwise as prohibited under this Agreement.</p>

<p>reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the YouTube Content and the YouTube Service.</p>
<p>E. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein,</p>
<p>including any use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any</p>
<p>commercial purposes.</p>
<p>F. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the YouTube Website or features</p>
<p>that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the YouTube Website or the Content</p>
<p>therein.</p>
<p>G. You understand that when using the YouTube Website, you will be exposed to User Submissions from a variety of sources,</p>
<p>and that YouTube is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such</p>
<p>User Submissions. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submissions that are</p>
<p>inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or</p>
<p>remedies you have or may have against YouTube with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold YouTube, its</p>
<p>Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your</p>
<p>use of the site.</p>
<p><strong>6. Your User Submissions and Conduct</strong></p>
<p>A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit video content ("User Videos") and textual content ("User Comments"). User</p>
<p>Videos and User Comments are collectively referred to as "User Submissions." You understand that whether or not such User</p>
<p>Submissions are published, YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions.</p>
<p>B. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In</p>
<p>connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: you own or have the necessary licenses, rights,</p>
<p>consents, and permissions to use and authorize YouTube to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other</p>
<p>proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner</p>
<p>contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to</p>
<p>YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use,</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the YouTube</p>
<p>Website and YouTube's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and</p>
<p>redistributing part or all of the YouTube Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media</p>
<p>channels. You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions</p>
<p>through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the</p>
<p>functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in User Videos terminate</p>
<p>within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your User Videos from the YouTube Service. You understand</p>
<p>and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Submissions that</p>
<p>have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Comments are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by</p>
<p>trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner</p>
<p>of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights</p>
<p>granted herein.</p>
<p>E. You further agree that you will not, in connection with User Submissions, submit material that is contrary to the YouTube</p>
<p>Community Guidelines, found at http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines, which may be updated from time to time, or</p>
<p>contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and</p>
<p>YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. YouTube does not permit copyright</p>
<p>infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and YouTube will remove all Content and User</p>
<p>Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Account Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a User's access to its Website if, under appropriate circumstances, they are determined to be a</p>
<p>repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms</p>
<p>of Service for violations other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory</p>
<p>material, or excessive length. YouTube may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading</p>
<p>such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your</p>
<p>copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright</p>
<p>Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is</p>
<p>allegedly infringed;</p>
<p>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online</p>
<p>site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be</p>
<p>removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to</p>
<p>locate the material;</p>
<p>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number,</p>
<p>and, if available, an electronic mail;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the</p>
<p>copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act</p>
<p>on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>YouTube's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: Heather Gillette, 901 Cherry Ave., San</p>
<p>Bruno, CA 94066, email: copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright</p>
<p>Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to</p>
<p>YouTube customer service through http://www.google.com/support/youtube. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of</p>
<p>the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not</p>
<p>infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post</p>
<p>and use the content in your User Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the</p>
<p>Copyright Agent:</p>
<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
<p>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the</p>
<p>content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a</p>
<p>misidentification of the content; and</p>
<p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who</p>
<p>provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining</p>
<p>party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the</p>
<p>copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be</p>
<p>replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at YouTube's sole</p>
<p>discretion.</p>
<p><strong>9. Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE YOUTUBE WEBSITE SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT</p>

<p><strong>11. Indemnity</strong></p>

<p>Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or</p>
<p>(iv) any claim that one of your User Submissions caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation</p>
<p>will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the YouTube Website.</p>

<p>consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and</p>
<p>warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm</p>
<p>that you are over the age of 13, as the YouTube Website is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age,</p>
<p>then please do not use the YouTube Website. There are lots of other great web sites for you. Talk to your parents about what</p>
<p>sites are appropriate for you.</p>

<p>You agree that: (i) the YouTube Website shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the YouTube Website shall be</p>
