<p>D. You agree not to use the Website, including the YouTube Embeddable Player for any commercial use, without the prior</p>
<p>written authorization of YouTube. Prohibited commercial uses include any of the following actions taken without YouTube's</p>

<p>use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable Player), for the primary purpose of gaining</p>
<p>advertising or subscription revenue;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, on the YouTube website or any third-party website, targeted to the content of specific User</p>
<p>Submissions or YouTube content;</p>
<p>and any use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable player) that YouTube finds, in its sole</p>
<p>discretion, to use YouTube's resources or User Submissions with the effect of competing with or displacing the</p>
<p>market for YouTube, YouTube content, or its User Submissions. (For more information about prohibited commercial</p>
<p>uses, see our FAQ.)</p>

<p>materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable</p>

<p>D. In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by</p>

<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and</p>
<p>YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. YouTube does not permit copyright</p>
<p>infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and YouTube will remove all Content and</p>
<p>User Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property</p>
<p>rights. YouTube reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Account Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a User's access to its Website if, under appropriate circumstances, they are determined to be a</p>
<p>repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these</p>
<p>Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not</p>
<p>limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. YouTube may remove such User</p>
<p>Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any</p>
<p>time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon</p>
<p>your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our</p>
<p>Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is</p>
<p>allegedly infringed;</p>
<p>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single</p>
<p>online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be</p>
<p>removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to</p>
<p>locate the material;</p>
<p>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone</p>
<p>number, and, if available, an electronic mail;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized</p>
<p>by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to</p>
<p>act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>YouTube's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: Heather Gillette, 1000 Cherry</p>
<p>Ave., Second Floor, San Bruno, CA 94066, email: copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices</p>
<p>should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other</p>
<p>communications should be directed to YouTube customer service through http://www.google.com/support/youtube. You</p>
<p>acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not</p>
<p>infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to</p>
<p>post and use the content in your User Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to</p>
<p>the Copyright Agent:</p>
<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
<p>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which</p>
<p>the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a</p>
<p>misidentification of the content; and</p>
<p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person</p>
<p>who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original</p>
<p>complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.</p>
<p>Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed</p>
<p>content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at</p>
<p>YouTube's sole discretion.</p>

<p>You agree that: (i) the YouTube Website shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the YouTube Website shall be</p>
<p>deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over YouTube, either specific or general, in</p>
<p>jurisdictions other than California. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of</p>
<p>California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and YouTube that arises in</p>

<p>a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and YouTube's failure to assert any right or provision under</p>

<p>changes. Your use of the YouTube Website following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to</p>
