</span>that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given<span style="background-color: red;"> period of</span>

removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-


notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.
