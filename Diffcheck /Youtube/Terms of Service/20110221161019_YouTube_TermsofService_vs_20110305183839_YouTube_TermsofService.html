<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written authorization,</p>

<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content</p>

<p>value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>

<p>human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,</p>
<p>YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole</p>
<p>purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches</p>

<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation,</p>
<p>or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. YouTube does</p>
<p>not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and YouTube will remove</p>
<p>all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. YouTube reserves the right to</p>
<p>remove Content without prior notice.</p>

<p>infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright</p>
