<span style="background-color: green;">Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective rights holders. This</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">U</span><span style="background-color: green;">
means, for example, that u</span>sing the Service does not give you ownership of <span style="background-color: red;">or rights to </span>any <span style="background-color: green;">in</span><span style="background-color: red;">aspec</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ellectual</span> <span style="background-color: green;">pr</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">perty rights in the Content you

Content posted by others or YouTub</span>e).


Changes to the Service


<span style="background-color: green;">YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part


of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply


with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will always consider and balance the impact of such


changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make


material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when


we need to make such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability


of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements.

If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content</span> to the Service<span style="background-color: green;">. </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>You<span style="background-color: green;"> may use your Content to promote


your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that


does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party


intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally


entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems


that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.


Rights you Grant


You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you

Licence to YouTube


By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,


sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose


of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.


Licence to Other Users


You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through


the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a


feature of the Service.


Duration of Licence


The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will


terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires


otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by


other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for


legal purposes.


Removing Your Content


You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before


removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.

risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the

By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable


license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it). YouTube may only use that

License to Other Users

make use of your Content independent of the Service.


Duration of License


Duration of License


The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will


terminate, with the only exceptions being where the Service operation, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law


otherwise requires. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to (a) recall promotional materials that


include your Content, (b) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the


Service (for example, as may be made available within a subscription offering</span>), <span style="background-color: green;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u give pe</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">mission


for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device


settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal,


worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of


the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by


YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part


of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these


restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.

Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence. There may be provisions in an open source


licence that expressly override some of these terms. If so, we will make that open source licence available to you.


Other Legal Terms


Warranty


We provide the Service with reasonable care and skill.


Disclaimer


By law, consumers have certain rights that cannot be excluded or altered by a contract. Nothing in this Agreement affects


those rights you may have as a consumer. Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as required by law, YouTube


does not make any specific promises about the Service. For example, we don’t make any promises about: the Content


provided through the Service; the specific features of the Service, or its accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability to meet your


needs; or that any Content you submit will be accessible or stored on the Service.


Limitation of Liability


All users: Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit any party’s liability for: death or personal injury; fraud;


fraudulent misrepresentation; or any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.


To the extent permitted by applicable law, YouTube and its Affiliates will not be responsible for:


1. losses that were not caused by YouTube or its Affiliates’ breach of this Agreement;


2. any loss or damage that was not, at the time that this Agreement was formed between you and YouTube, a reasonably


foreseeable consequence of YouTube or its Affiliates breaching this Agreement; or


3. the Content submitted by any user, or for the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any user.


Business Users only: If you are using the Service for the purpose of your trade, business, craft or profession,</span> (<span style="background-color: red;">c) delete copies we re</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">sonably</span> <span style="background-color: green;">“</span><span style="background-color: red;">need to keep

The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then


where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms.

arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the


jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to


such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be


litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and YouTube consent to


personal jurisdiction in those courts.
