YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader" and other applications.


B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control


over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition,

YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.


C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy


policy of each other website that you visit.


**3. YouTube Accounts**


A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google account. You may never use


another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.


You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.


You must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.


B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for


the losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.


**4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions**


YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service


(such as the Embeddable Player).


B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.


C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself,

the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content


delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of


sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:


uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or


artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising


restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or


any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.

permit YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.


H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers,"


that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time


than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the


foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site


for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,


but not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in

without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube and its licensors reserve all


rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.

prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.

violation of these Terms of Service.

a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
