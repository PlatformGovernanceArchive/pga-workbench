Rights you Grant


You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of


the Service, as described below.


License to YouTube


By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,


sublicensable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it).


YouTube may only use that Content in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates)


business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.


License to Other Users


You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through


the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it, only


as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights


or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.


Duration of License


The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content


from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server


copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. 


Removing Your Content


You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before


removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.


Removal of Content By YouTube


If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third


parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless


we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would


otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of


the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about


reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.


Copyright Protection


We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If


you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.


We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where


you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in


appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.


Account Suspension & Termination


Terminations by You


You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account,


which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your


data first.


Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause


YouTube may suspend or terminate your use of the Services, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all


or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a


legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to


any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.


Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes


YouTube may terminate your use of the Services, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube


believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. 


Notice for Termination or Suspension


We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)


would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our


Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any


user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your use for Service changes, where



reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.


Effect of Account Suspension or Termination


If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using


certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such


use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.
