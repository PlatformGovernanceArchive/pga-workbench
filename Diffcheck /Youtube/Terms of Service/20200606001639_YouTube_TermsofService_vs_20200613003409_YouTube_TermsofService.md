Continuation of this Agreement


If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “Other Legal Terms”,


“About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue as described under “Duration of License”.


Severance


If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.


<span style="background-color: red;">No </span>Waiver


If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any


rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).


Interpretation


In these <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">T</span>erms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative


purposes.


Governing Law


<span style="background-color: green;">The courts in some countries will not apply </span>California law <span style="background-color: green;">to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries,


then </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">ill govern all disputes arising out of or relating to t</span>he<span style="background-color: red;">se te</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ms or th</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms.


Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.</span>S<span style="background-color: green;">.A.</span><span style="background-color: red;">ervice</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">x</span><span style="background-color: red;">gardless of </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">onf</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ud</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">ng California’s </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">hoice</span> of law<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">s


</span>rules<span style="background-color: green;">, will apply to any disputes


arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">S</span><span style="background-color: red;">These d</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">spu</span><span style="background-color: green;">milarly, if </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> court</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> in your country</span> will <span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">be res</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">t permit you to consent to


the jurisdiction and </span>v<span style="background-color: green;">enue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will


apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services


will be litigat</span>ed exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you and YouTube<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts<span style="background-color: red;">.


If applicable local law prevents these disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file these disputes in


your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these


disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the laws of your country of residence</span>.
