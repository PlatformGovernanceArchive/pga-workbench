<p>does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party</p>

<p>feature of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of Licence</p>
<p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will</p>
<p>terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires</p>
<p>otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by</p>
<p>other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for</p>
<p>legal purposes.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>

<p>terminate, with the only exceptions being where the Service operation, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law</p>
<p>otherwise requires. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to (a) recall promotional materials that</p>
<p>include your Content, (b) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the</p>
<p>Service (for example, as may be made available within a subscription offering</span>), <span style="background-color: green;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u give pe</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">mission</p>

<p>the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by</p>
<p>YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part</p>
<p>of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these</p>
<p>restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>

<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence. There may be provisions in an open source</p>
<p>licence that expressly override some of these terms. If so, we will make that open source licence available to you.</p>
