8. <span style="background-color: green;">Digital Millennium </span>Copyright <span style="background-color: green;">Act


A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may


submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the


following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):


A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is


allegedly infringed;


Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single


online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;


Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to


be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service


provider to locate the material;


Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone


number, and, if available, an electronic mail;


A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized


by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and


A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized


to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


You may direct copyright infringement notifications to our DMCA Agent at 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, email:


copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other


feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to YouTube customer


service through https://support.google.com/youtube. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the


requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.


B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or


that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and


use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright


Agent:


Your physical or electronic signature;


Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which


the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;


A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a


misidentification of the Content; and


Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the


federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person


who provided notification of the alleged infringement.


If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original


complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.


Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the


removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-


notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.
