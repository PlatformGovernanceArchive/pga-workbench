YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service </span>(<span style="background-color: green;">su</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ollectively t</span>h<span style="background-color: green;"> as th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">


Embeddable Player).

D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:


the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content


delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient


value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:


uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or


artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising

Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.


G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from

YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.

human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,


YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole


purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches

communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree

written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly

responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You further


understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and


you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against YouTube with


respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its owners,

thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive


license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as

subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are


otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.


E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the YouTube

F. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation,


or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. YouTube does


not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and YouTube will remove


all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. YouTube reserves the right to


remove Content without prior notice.


**7. Account Termination Policy**


A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat


infringer.

infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without prior


notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user'su account for submitting such material in


violation of these Terms of Service.
