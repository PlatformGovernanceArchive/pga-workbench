otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of


</span>the Service<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;">;</span> or <span style="background-color: red;">any</span><span style="background-color: green;">(c)</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">part

intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally


entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems


that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.


Rights you Grant


You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of


the Service, as described below.


License to YouTube


By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,


sublicensable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it). YouTube may


only use that license in order to operate, promote and improve the Service. For clarity, nothing in these Terms is intended to


grant YouTube a wider scope of license than that permitted by law.


License to Other Users


You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through


the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a


feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions


for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.


Duration of License


The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will


terminate, with the only exceptions being where the Service operation, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the


law otherwise requires. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to (a) recall promotional materials


that include your Content, (b) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of


the Service (for example, as may be made available within a subscription offering), or (c) delete copies we reasonably need to


keep for legal purposes.


Removing Your Content


You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before


removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.


Removal of Content By YouTube


If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third


parties, we may remove or take down that Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action without delay unless we


reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would be prohibited due to legal reasons; or (b) could cause harm to any user, other third


party, YouTube or our Affiliates (for example, but not limiting to, in cases where this notification would violate the law or a


legal enforcement authority’s directive, compromise an investigation, or compromise the security of any Services). You can


learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.


Copyright Protection


We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If


you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.


We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where


you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in


appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.


Account Suspension & Termination


Terminations by You


You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your Google Account,


which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your


data first.


Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause


YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the


Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal


requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,


other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.


Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes


YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes that


provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. 


Notice for Termination or Suspension


We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube without delay unless we reasonably believe that


to do so: (a) would be prohibited due to legal reasons; or (b) could cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our


Affiliates (for example, but not limiting to, in cases where this notification would violate the law or a legal enforcement


authority’s directive, compromise an investigation, or compromise the security of any Services). Where YouTube is



terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export


your Content from the Service.


Effect of Account Suspension or Termination


If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using</span>


certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such


use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.


About Software in the Service


Downloadable Software


When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission


for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device


settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal,


worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of


the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by


YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part


of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these


restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.


Open Source


Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may


be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those


licenses.

visit.

 Test new features 


We may modify this Agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.


YouTube will provide no less than thirty (30) days advance notice of any material modifications to this Agreement and the


opportunity to review them, except that modifications addressing newly available features of the Service that are favorable to


users or modifications made for legal reasons may be effective immediately, without notice. Modifications to this Agreement


will only apply going forward. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should remove any Content you have uploaded


and discontinue your use of the Service.</span>


Continuation of this Agreement


If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: “Other Legal Terms”,


“About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue as described under “Duration of License”.


Severance


If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.


<span style="background-color: green;">No </span>Waiver


If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any


rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).


Interpretation


In these <span style="background-color: red;">T</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>erms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative


purposes.

arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to


the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will


apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services


</span>will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA<span style="background-color: green;">.</span><span style="background-color: red;">, and you and</span> You<span style="background-color: green;"> and


You</span>Tube<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
