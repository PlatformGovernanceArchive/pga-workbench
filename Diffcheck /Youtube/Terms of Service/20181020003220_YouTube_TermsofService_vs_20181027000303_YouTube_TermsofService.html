<p>you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:</p>
<p>A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,</p>
<p>in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such</p>
<p>distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);</p>
<p>B. you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the YouTube</p>
<p>Player and its related technologies);</p>
<p>C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website</p>
<p>itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;</p>
<p>D. you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the</p>
<p>Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or</p>
<p>the content accessible via the Service;</p>

<p>providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at YouTube's sole discretion, without</p>
<p>prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you</p>

</ol>
<p>14.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and YouTube and govern your use of the Service and</p>
<p>completely replace any prior agreements between you and YouTube in relation to the Service. All other terms of service that</p>
<p>Google Inc. and any of its subsidiaries may have in place from time to time are expressly excluded from the Terms.</p>
<p>14.2 You agree that YouTube may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,</p>
<p>regular mail, or postings on the Service.</p>
<p>14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or</p>
<p>which YouTube has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of YouTube's rights</p>
<p>and that those rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.</p>
<p>14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then</p>

<p>will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>14.5 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which YouTube is a part shall be third party</p>
<p>beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of</p>

<p>party beneficiary of the Terms.</p>
<p>14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with YouTube under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and YouTube</p>
<p>agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, you agree that YouTube shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types</p>
<p>of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.</p>
