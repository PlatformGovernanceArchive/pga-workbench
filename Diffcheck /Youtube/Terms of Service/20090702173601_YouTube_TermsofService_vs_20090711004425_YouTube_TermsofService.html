<p><strong>1. Your Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>A. By using and/or visiting this website (collectively, including all content and functionality available through the YouTube.com domain</p>
<p>name, the "YouTube Website", or "Website"), you signify your agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"),</p>
<p>(2)YouTube's privacy notice, found at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy and incorporated here by reference, and (3) YouTube's</p>
<p>Community Guidelines, found at http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines and also incorporated here by reference. If you do not</p>
<p>agree to any of these terms, the YouTube privacy notice, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the YouTube Website.</p>
<p>B. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most</p>
<p>up-to-date version http://www.youtube.com/t/terms). YouTube may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and</p>
<p>policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer</p>
<p>any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
<p><strong>2. YouTube Website</strong></p>
<p>A. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the YouTube Website, including users who are also contributors of video content,</p>
<p>information, and other materials or services on the Website. The YouTube Website includes all aspects of YouTube, including but not</p>
<p>limited to all products, software and services offered via the website such as the YouTube channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player,"</p>
<p>the YouTube "Uploader" and other applications.</p>
<p>B. The YouTube Website may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control</p>
<p>over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, YouTube will</p>
<p>not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Website, you expressly relieve YouTube from any and all</p>
<p>liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</p>
<p>C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the YouTube Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy</p>
<p>policy of each other website that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>3. YouTube Accounts</strong></p>
<p>A. In order to access some features of the Website, you will have to create a YouTube account. You may never use another's account</p>
<p>without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for</p>
<p>the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify YouTube immediately of any</p>
<p>breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of</p>
<p>YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<p><strong>4. General Use of the Website—Permissions and Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Website as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
<p>A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Website, including but not limited to User Submissions (defined below),</p>
<p>without YouTube's prior written authorization.</p>
<p>B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website, including but not limited to YouTube's Embeddable Player or any of its related</p>
<p>technologies.</p>
<p>C. You agree not to access User Submissions (defined below) or YouTube Content through any technology or means other than the video</p>
<p>playback pages of the Website itself, the YouTube Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.</p>
<p>D. You agree not to use the Website, including the YouTube Embeddable Player for any commercial use, without the prior written</p>
<p>authorization of YouTube. Prohibited commercial uses include any of the following actions taken without YouTube's express approval:</p>
<p>sale of access to the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable Player) on another website;</p>
<p>use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable Player), for the primary purpose of gaining advertising or</p>
<p>subscription revenue;</p>
<p>the sale of advertising, on the YouTube website or any third-party website, targeted to the content of specific User Submissions or</p>
<p>YouTube content;</p>
<p>and any use of the Website or its related services (such as the Embeddable player) that YouTube finds, in its sole discretion, to use</p>
<p>YouTube's resources or User Submissions with the effect of competing with or displacing the market for YouTube, YouTube</p>
<p>content, or its User Submissions. (For more information about prohibited commercial uses, see our FAQ.)</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or artistic</p>
<p>enterprise;</p>
<p>using the Embeddable Player to show YouTube videos on an ad-enabled blog or website, provided the primary purpose of using</p>
<p>the Embeddable Player is not to gain advertising revenue or compete with YouTube;</p>
<p>any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.</p>
<p>(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)</p>
<p>F. If you use the YouTube Embeddable Player on your website, you must include a prominent link back to the YouTube website on the</p>
<p>pages containing the Embeddable Player and you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion of the Embeddable Player in any way.</p>
<p>G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from YouTube.</p>
<p>These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced</p>
<p>functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit YouTube to deliver</p>
<p>these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.</p>
<p>H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses</p>
<p>the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time than a human can</p>
<p>reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants</p>
<p>the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to</p>
<p>the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.</p>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any</p>
<p>personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Website, nor to use the communication systems provided by the</p>
<p>Website (e.g. comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users</p>
<p>of the Website with respect to their User Submissions.</p>
<p>I. In your use of the website, you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, YouTube Community</p>
<p>Guidelines, and all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Website.</p>
<p>A. The content on the YouTube Website, except all User Submissions (as defined below), including without limitation, the text, software,</p>
<p>scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, interactive features and the like ("Content") and the trademarks, service marks and</p>
<p>logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to YouTube, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under</p>
<p>the law. Content on the Website is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only and may not be downloaded, copied,</p>
<p>reproduced, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any other purposes whatsoever</p>
<p>without the prior written consent of the respective owners. YouTube reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Website and</p>
<p>the Content.</p>
<p>B. You may access User Submissions for your information and personal use solely as intended through the provided functionality of the</p>
<p>YouTube Website. You shall not copy or download any User Submission unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by</p>
<p>YouTube on the YouTube Website for that User Submission.</p>
<p>C. User Comments are made available to you for your information and personal use solely as intended through the normal functionality of</p>
<p>the YouTube Website. User Comments are made available "as is", and may not be used, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted,</p>
<p>broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, downloaded, or otherwise exploited in any manner not intended by the normal functionality of the</p>
<p>YouTube Website or otherwise as prohibited under this Agreement.</p>
<p>D. You may access YouTube Content, User Submissions and other content only as permitted under this Agreement. YouTube reserves all</p>
<p>rights not expressly granted in and to the YouTube Content and the YouTube Website.</p>
<p>E. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any</p>
<p>use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any commercial purposes.</p>
<p>F. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the YouTube Website or features that prevent</p>
<p>or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the YouTube Website or the Content therein.</p>
<p>G. You understand that when using the YouTube Website, you will be exposed to User Submissions from a variety of sources, and that</p>
<p>YouTube is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Submissions.</p>
<p>You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or</p>
<p>objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against</p>
<p>YouTube with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold YouTube, its Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to</p>
<p>the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the site.</p>
<p><strong>6. Your User Submissions and Conduct</strong></p>
<p>A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit video content ("User Videos") and textual content ("User Comments"). User Videos and</p>
<p>User Comments are collectively referred to as "User Submissions." You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are</p>
<p>published, YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions.</p>
<p>B. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection</p>
<p>with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and</p>
<p>permissions to use and authorize YouTube to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any</p>
<p>and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these</p>
<p>Terms of Service.</p>
<p>C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to YouTube, you</p>
<p>hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute,</p>
<p>prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the YouTube Website and YouTube's (and its</p>
<p>successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the YouTube Website</p>
<p>(and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube</p>
<p>Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and</p>
<p>perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service. The above</p>
<p>licenses granted by you in User Videos terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your User Videos</p>
<p>from the YouTube Website. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server</p>
<p>copies of User Submissions that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Comments are perpetual</p>
<p>and irrevocable.</p>
<p>D. In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or</p>
<p>otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have</p>
<p>permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.</p>
<p>E. You further agree that you will not, in connection with User Submissions, submit material that is contrary to the YouTube Community</p>
<p>Guidelines, found at http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines, which may be updated from time to time, or contrary to applicable</p>
<p>local, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>F. YouTube does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube</p>
<p>expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. YouTube does not permit copyright infringing activities</p>
<p>and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and YouTube will remove all Content and User Submissions if properly</p>
<p>notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. YouTube reserves the right to remove</p>
<p>Content and User Submissions without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>7. Account Termination Policy</strong></p>
<p>A. YouTube will terminate a User's access to its Website if, under appropriate circumstances, they are determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service</p>
<p>for violations other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive</p>
<p>length. YouTube may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of</p>
<p>these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights,</p>
<p>you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the</p>
<p>following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
<p>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are</p>
<p>covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or</p>
<p>access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
<p>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if</p>
<p>available, an electronic mail;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright</p>
<p>owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
<p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of</p>
<p>the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>YouTube's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: Heather Gillette, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno,</p>
<p>CA 94066, email: copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other</p>
<p>feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to YouTube customer service</p>
<p>through http://www.google.com/support/youtube. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section</p>
<p>5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that</p>
<p>you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in</p>
<p>your User Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>
<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
<p>Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content</p>
<p>appeared before it was removed or disabled;</p>
<p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification</p>
<p>of the content; and</p>
<p>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in</p>
<p>San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the</p>
<p>alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party</p>
<p>informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner</p>
<p>files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it</p>
<p>restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>9. Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE YOUTUBE WEBSITE SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p>
<p>LAW, YOUTUBE, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN</p>
<p>CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE AND YOUR USE THEREOF. YOUTUBE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT</p>

<p>INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA</p>
<p>THE YOUTUBE WEBSITE. YOUTUBE DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY</p>
<p>PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE YOUTUBE WEBSITE OR ANY HYPERLINKED</p>
<p>WEBSITE OR FEATURED IN ANY BANNER OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND YOUTUBE WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE</p>

<p>CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p>
<p>SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE</p>
<p>APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUTUBE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR USER SUBMISSIONS OR THE DEFAMATORY,</p>
<p>OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS</p>
<p>ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</p>
<p>The Website is controlled and offered by YouTube from its facilities in the United States of America. YouTube makes no representations that</p>
<p>the YouTube Website is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the YouTube Website from other</p>
<p>jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p>
<p><strong>11. Indemnity</strong></p>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its parent corporation, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and</p>
<p>against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees)</p>
<p>arising from: (i) your use of and access to the YouTube Website; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of</p>
<p>any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that one of your User Submissions</p>
<p>caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the YouTube</p>
<p>Website.</p>
<p><strong>12. Ability to Accept Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are</p>
<p>fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these</p>
<p>Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the</p>
<p>YouTube Website is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use the YouTube Website. There</p>
<p>are lots of other great web sites for you. Talk to your parents about what sites are appropriate for you.</p>
<p><strong>13. Assignment</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by</p>
<p>YouTube without restriction.</p>
<p><strong>14. General</strong></p>
<p>You agree that: (i) the YouTube Website shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the YouTube Website shall be deemed a</p>
<p>passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over YouTube, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws</p>
<p>principles. Any claim or dispute between you and YouTube that arises in whole or in part from your use of the YouTube Website shall be</p>
<p>decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California. These Terms of Service, together with the</p>
<p>Privacy Notice at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy and any other legal notices published by YouTube on the Website, shall constitute the</p>
<p>entire agreement between you and YouTube concerning the YouTube Website. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid</p>
<p>by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of</p>
<p>Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or</p>
<p>continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and YouTube's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall</p>
<p>not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YouTube reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice,</p>
<p>and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the YouTube Website following any amendment of</p>
<p>these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF</p>
<p>ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE YOUTUBE WEBSITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF</p>
<p>ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
