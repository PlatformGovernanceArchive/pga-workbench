<p>Welcome to YouTube!</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we</p>
<p>make available to you as part of the platform (collectively, the “Service”). </p>
<p>Our Service</p>
<p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content,</p>
<p>provides a forum for people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe,</p>
<p>and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large</p>
<p>and small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in</p>
<p>our Help Center. Among other things, you can find out about YouTube Kids, the</p>
<p>YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases (where</p>
<p>available).You can also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your</p>
<p>television, your games console, or Google Home.</p>
<p>Your Service Provider</p>
<p>The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws</p>
<p>of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA</p>
<p>94043 (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to YouTube’s</p>
<p>“Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc.</p>
<p>corporate group (now or in the future).</p>
<p>Applicable Terms</p>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community</p>
<p>Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies which may be updated from</p>
<p>time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the</p>
<p>Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the</p>
<p>Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references</p>
<p>provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the</p>
<p>Agreement.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not</p>
<p>understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Who may use the Service?</p>
<p>Age Requirements</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; however, children of all ages may</p>
<p>use the Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal</p>
<p>guardian.</p>
<p>Permission by Parent or Guardian</p>
<p>If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s permission</p>
<p>to use the Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your</p>
<p>child to use the Service, you are subject to the terms of this Agreement and</p>
<p>responsible for your child’s activity on the Service. You can find tools and resources to</p>
<p>help you manage your family’s experience on YouTube (including how to enable a child</p>
<p>under the age of 13 to use the Service and YouTube Kids) in our Help Center and</p>
<p>through Google’s Family Link.</p>
<p>Businesses</p>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you represent that</p>
<p>you have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that such entity accepts this</p>
<p>Agreement.</p>
<p>Your Use of the Service</p>
<p>Content on the Service</p>
<p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other</p>
<p>sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including</p>
<p>trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software,</p>
<p>metrics, and other materials whether provided by you, YouTube or a third-party</p>
<p>(collectively, "Content”).</p>
<p>Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service.</p>
<p>YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve Content. If you see any Content you</p>
<p>believe does not comply with this Agreement, including by violating the Community</p>
<p>Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.</p>
<p>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</p>
<p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without</p>
<p>having a Google account. However, you do need a Google account to use some</p>
<p>features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to</p>
<p>channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these</p>
<p>instructions to create a Google account.</p>
<p>Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions,</p>
<p>such as uploading videos, making comments or creating playlists (where available).</p>
<p>Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube channel.</p>
<p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not</p>
<p>reuse your Google account password on third-party applications. Learn more about</p>
<p>keeping your Google account secure, including what to do if you learn of any</p>
<p>unauthorized use of your password or Google account.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy</p>
<p>when you use the Service. The YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional</p>
<p>information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.</p>
<p>We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in</p>
<p>accordance with the YouTube Data Processing Terms, except in cases where you</p>
<p>uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn More.</p>

<p>Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a</p>
<p>webpage where YouTube videos are the main draw for users visiting the</p>
<p>webpage).</p>
<p>Reservation</p>
<p>Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the</p>
<p>Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.</p>
<p>Changes to the Service</p>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter</p>
<p>or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security</p>
<p>improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply with law, or</p>
<p>prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all</p>
<p>users, some users or even an individual user. Whenever reasonably possible, we will</p>
<p>provide notice when we discontinue or make material changes to our Service that will</p>
<p>have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, you understand and</p>
<p>agree that there will be times when we make such changes without notice, such as</p>
<p>where we feel we need to take action to improve the security and operability of our</p>
<p>Service, prevent abuse, or comply with legal requirements. </p>
<p>Your Content and Conduct</p>
<p>Uploading Content</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You</p>
<p>may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to</p>
<p>upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply</p>
<p>with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) or the law. For</p>
<p>example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such</p>
<p>as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise</p>
<p>legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the</p>
<p>Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect</p>
<p>infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p>Rights you Grant</p>
<p>You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant</p>
<p>certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<p>License to YouTube</p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive,</p>
<p>royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to</p>
<p>reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection</p>
<p>with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including</p>
<p>for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.</p>
<p>License to Other Users</p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free</p>
<p>license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including</p>
<p>to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as</p>
<p>enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity,</p>
<p>this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your</p>
<p>Content independent of the Service.</p>
<p>Duration of License</p>
<p>The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time</p>
<p>after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree,</p>
<p>however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies</p>
<p>of your videos that have been removed or deleted. </p>
<p>Right to Monetize</p>
<p>You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such</p>
<p>monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee</p>
<p>for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting November</p>
<p>18, 2020, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other</p>
<p>agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the</p>
<p>YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as</p>
<p>royalties. If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.</p>
<p>Removing Your Content</p>
<p>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to</p>
<p>make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you</p>
<p>no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p>Removal of Content By YouTube</p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause</p>
<p>harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content</p>
<p>in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably</p>
<p>believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement</p>
<p>authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would</p>
<p>compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would</p>
<p>cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more</p>
<p>about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page</p>
<p>of our Help Center.</p>
<p>Copyright Protection</p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property</p>
<p>online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If you believe your copyright has been</p>
<p>infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in</p>
<p>our YouTube Copyright Center, where you can also find information about how to</p>
<p>resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in</p>
<p>appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<p>Account Suspension &amp; Termination</p>
<p>Terminations by You</p>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the</p>
<p>Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and</p>
<p>removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.</p>
<p>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause</p>
<p>YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google</p>
<p>account’s access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach</p>
<p>this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a</p>
<p>court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create)</p>
<p>liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of</p>
<p>the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to</p>
<p>you is no longer commercially viable. </p>
<p>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we</p>
<p>reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal</p>
<p>enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the</p>
<p>Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our</p>
<p>Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where</p>
<p>reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content</p>
<p>from the Service.</p>
<p>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is</p>
<p>restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing</p>
<p>only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you</p>
<p>believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this</p>
<p>form.</p>
<p>About Software in the Service</p>
<p>Downloadable Software</p>
<p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube</p>
<p>Studio application), you give permission for that software to update automatically on</p>
<p>your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings.</p>
<p>Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube</p>
<p>gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive</p>
<p>license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This</p>
<p>license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the</p>
<p>Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are</p>
<p>not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to</p>
<p>reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws</p>
<p>prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p>Open Source</p>
<p>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that</p>
<p>we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that</p>
<p>expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses. </p>
<p>Other Legal Terms</p>
<p>Warranty Disclaimer</p>
<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AS</p>
<p>REQUIRED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND YOUTUBE</p>

<p>ABOUT THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY</p>
<p>WARRANTIES ABOUT: (A) THE CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE</p>
<p>SERVICE; (B) THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE SERVICE, OR ITS</p>
<p>ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR</p>
<p>NEEDS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT YOU SUBMIT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE</p>
<p>ON THE SERVICE. </p>
<p>Limitation of Liability</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUTUBE, ITS AFFILIATES,</p>
<p>OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE</p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, BUSINESS</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR</p>

</ol>
<p>INCLUDING YOUR USE OF CONTENT; AND/OR</p>

</ol>
<p>THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER</p>
<p>THE CLAIM ASSERTED IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR</p>
<p>ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.</p>
<p>YOUTUBE AND ITS AFFILIATES’ TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS</p>
<p>ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE</p>

<p>AND (B) USD $500.</p>
<p>Indemnity</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold</p>
<p>harmless YouTube, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and</p>
<p>against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and</p>
<p>expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and</p>
<p>access to the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your</p>
<p>violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or</p>
<p>privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party. This</p>
<p>defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the</p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>Third-Party Links</p>
<p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not</p>
<p>owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no</p>
<p>responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you leave the</p>

<p>and online service that you visit.</p>

<p>We may modify this Agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for</p>
<p>legal, regulatory, or security reasons. YouTube will provide reasonable advance</p>
<p>notice of any material modifications to this Agreement and the opportunity to review</p>
<p>them, except that modifications addressing newly available features of the Service or</p>
<p>modifications made for legal reasons may be effective immediately without notice.</p>

<p>does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to</p>
<p>take action in the future).</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any</p>
<p>examples we give are for illustrative purposes.</p>

<p>All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service will be governed by</p>
<p>California law, except California’s conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively</p>
