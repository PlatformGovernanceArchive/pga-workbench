PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAUSED B</span>Y<span style="background-color: red;">ouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote


your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that


does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party


intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally


entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems


that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.


Rights you Grant


You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you


to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.


Licence to YouTube


By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,


sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose


of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.


Licence to Other Users


You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through


the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a


feature of the Service.


Duration of Licence


The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will


terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires


otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by


other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for


legal purposes.


Removing Your Content


You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before


removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.


Removal of Content By YouTube


If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third


parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we


reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise


risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the


Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting


and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.


Copyright Protection


We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If


you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.


We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where


you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in


appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.


Account Suspension and Termination


Terminations by You


You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves


closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy of your data first. 


Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause


YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the


Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal


requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,


other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.


Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes


YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube reasonably


believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. 


Notice for Termination or Suspension


We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)


would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our



Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any


user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where


reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.


Effect of Account Suspension or Termination


If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using


certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such


use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.


About Software in our Service


Downloadable Software


When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission


for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device


settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal,


worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of


the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by


YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part


of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these


restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.

Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence that we make available to you. There may


be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those


licenses.


Other Legal Terms


Warranty


We provide the Service with reasonable care and skill.


Disclaimer


By law, consumers have certain rights that cannot be excluded or altered by a contract. Nothing in this Agreement affects


those rights you may have as a consumer. Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as required by law, YouTube


does not make any specific promises about the Service. For example, we don’t make any promises about: the Content


provided through the Service; the specific features of the Service, or its accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability to meet your


needs; or that any Content you submit will be accessible or stored on the Service.


Limitation of Liability


All users: Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit any party’s liability for: death or personal injury; fraud;


fraudulent misrepresentation; or any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.
