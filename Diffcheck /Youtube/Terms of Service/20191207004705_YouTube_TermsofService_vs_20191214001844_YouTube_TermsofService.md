Welcome</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to</span><span style="background-color: red;">دﯾﺳﻣﺑر</span> <span style="background-color: green;">YouTube!


English Courtesy Translation


Introduction


Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the


platform (collectively, the “Service”). 


Our Service


The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform,


and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and


small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Amongst other things, you


can find out about YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases. You can


also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or even Google Home.


Your Service Provider


The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600


Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). References to YouTube’s


“Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group.


Applicable Terms


Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright


Policies (together, the "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you


provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your Content.


Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not


accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.


Who may use the Service?


Age Requirements


You may use the Service if you are at least 13 years old.


Children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.


Permission by Parent or Guardian


If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this


Agreement with you.


If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject


to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the Service. You can find tools and resources to


help you manage your family’s experience on YouTube in our Help Center and through Google’s Family Link.


Businesses


If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm to us that you have authority to act on behalf


of that entity, and that entity accepts this Agreement.


Your Use of the Service


Content on the Service


The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, text (such as


comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software,



metrics, and other materials whether provided by you, YouTube or a third party (collectively, "Content”). Content may be


provided to the Service and distributed by our users and YouTube is a provider of hosting services for such Content. Content


is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. If you see any Content you believe does not comply


with this Agreement, such as by violating the Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it to us.


Google Accounts and YouTube Channels


You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a Google account. However,


you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to


channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Google account.


Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading videos, making


comments or creating playlists. Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube channel.


To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account password on


third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, including what to do if you learn of any


unauthorised use of your password or Google account.


Your Information


Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service. The


YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids.


We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the YouTube Data


Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes or household activities. Learn


More.


Permissions and Restrictions


You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and the law. You


may view or listen to Content for your personal, non-commercial use. You may also show YouTube videos through the


embeddable YouTube player.


The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:


1. access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any


part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as specifically permitted by the Service; (b) with prior written permission


from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders; or (c) as permitted by applicable law;


2. circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage with, or otherwise interfere with the Service (or attempt to do any of these


things), including security-related features or features that: (a) prevent or restrict the copying or other use of Content; or


(b) limit the use of the Service or Content;


3. access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except: (a) in the case of public


search engines, in accordance with YouTube’s robots.txt file; (b) with YouTube’s prior written permission; or (c) as


permitted by applicable law;


4. collect or use any information that might identify a person (for example, harvesting usernames), unless permitted by that


person or allowed under section 3 above;


5. use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations


(spam);


6. cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, including by paying


people or providing them with incentives to increase a video’s views, likes, or dislikes, or to increase a channel’s


subscribers, or otherwise manipulate metrics;


7. misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or


frivolous submissions;


8. run contests on or through the Service that do not comply with YouTube’s contest policies and guidelines;


9. use the Service to view or listen to Content other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, you may not


publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or

Content, other than those allowed in the Advertising on YouTube policies (such as compliant product placements); or (b)


sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from


the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage


where YouTube videos are the only content of value)</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">


Reservation


Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective rights holders. This


means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you


access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).


Changes to the Service


YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part


of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply


with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will always consider and balance the impact of such


changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make


material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when


we need to make such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability


of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements. 



Your Content and Conduct


Uploading Content


If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote


your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that


does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party


intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally


entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems


that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.


Rights you Grant


You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you


to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.


Licence to YouTube


By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,


sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose


of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.


Licence to Other Users


You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through


the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a


feature of the Service.


Duration of Licence


The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will


terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires


otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by


other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for


legal purposes.


Removing Your Content


You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before


removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.


Removal of Content By YouTube


If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third


parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we


reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise


risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the


Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting


and enforcement, including how to appeal on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.


Copyright Protection


We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube Copyright Center. If


you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.


We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube Copyright Center, where


you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in


appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.


Account Suspension and Termination


Terminations by You


You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves


closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy of your data first. 


Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause


YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the


Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal


requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user,


other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.


Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes


YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube reasonably


believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. 


Notice for Termination or Suspension


We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)


would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our



Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any


user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where


reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.


Effect of Account Suspension or Termination


If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using


certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such


use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.


About Software in our Service


Downloadable Software


When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission


for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device


settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal,


worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of


the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by


YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part


of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these


restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.


Open Source


Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence that we make available to you. There may


be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those


licenses.


Other Legal Terms


Warranty


We provide the Service with reasonable care and skill.


Disclaimer


By law, consumers have certain rights that cannot be excluded or altered by a contract. Nothing in this Agreement affects


those rights you may have as a consumer. Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as required by law, YouTube


does not make any specific promises about the Service. For example, we don’t make any promises about: the Content


provided through the Service; the specific features of the Service, or its accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability to meet your


needs; or that any Content you submit will be accessible or stored on the Service.


Limitation of Liability


All users: Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit any party’s liability for: death or personal injury; fraud;


fraudulent misrepresentation; or any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.


To the extent permitted by applicable law, YouTube and its Affiliates will not be responsible for:


1. losses that were not caused by YouTube or its Affiliates’ breach of this Agreement;


2. any loss or damage that was not, at the time that this Agreement was formed between you and YouTube, a reasonably


foreseeable consequence of YouTube or its Affiliates breaching this Agreement; or


3. the Content submitted by any user, or for the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any user.


Business Users only: If you are using the Service for the purpose of your trade, business, craft or profession, (a “Business


User”), to the extent permitted by applicable law, the following limitations of liability will also apply:


1. YouTube and its Affiliates will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data; loss of opportunity or anticipated


savings; indirect or consequential losses, or punitive damages (in all cases whether such losses were foreseeable or


not); and


2. YouTube and its Affiliates’ total liability for any claims arising from or relating to the Service is limited to the greater of: (a)


the amount of revenue that YouTube has paid to you from your use of the Service in the 12 months before the date of


your notice, in writing to YouTube, of the claim and (b) €500, whichever is higher.


Third-Party Links


The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by YouTube.


YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services. Be aware when you


leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you


visit.


About this Agreement


Modifying this Agreement


We may modify this Agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.


YouTube will provide reasonable advance notice of any material modifications to this Agreement and the opportunity to review


these changes. However, changes addressing newly available features of the Service or changes made for legal reasons may


be effective immediately without notice. Changes will only apply going forward. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you

rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).


Governing Law

disputes may be brought in the courts of England and Wales.

<span style="background-color: red;">1. Your relationship with YouTube


1.1 Your use of the YouTube website (the "Website") and any YouTube products, channels, software, data feeds and


services, including the YouTube embeddable video player (the "YouTube Player") provided to you on or from or through the


Website by YouTube (collectively the "Service") is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and YouTube.


"YouTube" means YouTube LLC, whose principal place of business is at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, United


States.


1.2 Your legal agreement with YouTube is made up of (A) the terms and conditions set out in this document, (B) YouTube's

(https://www.youtube.qa/t/community\_guidelines) (collectively called the "Terms").


1.3 The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and YouTube in relation to your use of the Service. It is


important that you take the time to read them carefully.


1.4 The Terms apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content, on the Service.


"Content" includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive


features and other materials you may view on, access through or contribute to the Service.


2. Accepting the Terms


2.1 In order to use the Service, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Service if you do not accept the

3. Changes to the Terms


YouTube reserves the right to make changes the Terms from time to time, for example to address changes to the law or

https://www.youtube.qa/t/terms or made available within the Service (for any modified additional terms). If you do not agree to

5. General restrictions on use


5.1 YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and


you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:


A. you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content,


in any medium without YouTube's prior written authorisation, unless YouTube makes available the means for such


distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);


B. you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the YouTube


Player and its related technologies);


C. you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website


itself, the YouTube Player, or such other means as YouTube may explicitly designate for this purpose;

Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or

ii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions placed on or within the Service, or Content;


iii. the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content


delivered via the Service unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of


sufficient value to be the basis for such sales


F. prohibited commercial uses shall not include (i) uploading an original video to YouTube, (ii) maintaining an original


channel on the Website in order to promote a business or artistic enterprise, (iii) showing YouTube videos through the


YouTube Player or otherwise on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to those advertising restrictions set out in


5.1(E)(iii) above; and (iv) any use that is expressly authorised by YouTube in writing;

YouTube Player including but not limited to links back to the Website;


H. you agree not to use or launch any automated system (including, without limitation, any robot, spider or offline reader)


that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of


time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a publicly available, standard (i.e. not


modified) web browser;


I. you agree not to collect or harvest any personal data of any user of the Website or any Service (and agree that this


shall be deemed to include YouTube account names);


J. you agree not to use the Website or the Services (including the comments and email features in the Website) for the

contemporaneous digital transmission of the material by YouTube via the Internet to a user operated Internet enabled


device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be downloaded (either


permanently or temporarily), copied, stored, or redistributed by the user.


M. You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content


for any other purposes without the prior written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content.

times during your use of the Service.


5.3 YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the


sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.


YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.


5.4 YouTube is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and


agree that the form and nature of the Service which YouTube provides may change from time to time without prior notice to


you.

providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at YouTube's sole discretion, without


prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you


stop using the Service.


5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that YouTube has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any


breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which YouTube may


suffer) of any such breach.


6. Copyright policy
