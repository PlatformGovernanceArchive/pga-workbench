YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:


the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content


delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient


value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:


uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or


artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising


restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or


any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.


(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)

Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.

than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the


foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for


the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but


not caches or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific

prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and YouTube's (and its


successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and


derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the


Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and


perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above


licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you

recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with


Content. YouTube does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service,


and YouTube will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights.


YouTube reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.


7. Account Termination Policy


A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a


repeat infringer.

infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without prior


notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in


violation of these Terms of Service.

complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.


Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed


Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at


YouTube's sole discretion.

agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:

through functionality offered by the Service (such as the YouTube Player);

**Terms of Service**



H. you agree not to use or launch any automated system (including, without limitation, any robot, spider or offline reader) that

permitted by the normal functionality of the Service, and solely for Streaming. "Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital

data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be downloaded (either permanently or temporarily), copied, stored, or


redistributed by the user.

during your use of the Service.


5.3 YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole

reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.


5.4 YouTube is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that


the form and nature of the Service which YouTube provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.


5.5 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that YouTube may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing


the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at YouTube's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.


You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you stop using the Service.


5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that YouTube has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach


of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which YouTube may suffer) of any


such breach.

6.2 As part of YouTube's copyright policy, YouTube will terminate user access to the Service if a user has been determined to be a


repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice.

shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and YouTube's failure to assert any right or provision


under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YouTube reserves the right to amend these


Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your


use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised

rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.


14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that


provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue

YouTube is entering into this agreement with you not only in its own right but also as trustee and agent for each such entities.
