“Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive


features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes all aspects of


YouTube, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via the YouTube website, such as the YouTube


channels, the YouTube "Embeddable Player," the YouTube "Uploader" and other applications.


B. The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouTube. YouTube has no control


over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition,


YouTube will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve


YouTube from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.


C. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy


of each other website that you visit.


3. YouTube Accounts


A. In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a YouTube or Google account. You may never use


another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You


are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You


must notify YouTube immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.


B. Although YouTube will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the


losses of YouTube or others due to such unauthorized use.


4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions


YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:


A. You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written authorization,


unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the


Embeddable Player).


B. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.


C. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, the


Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.


D. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:


the sale of access to the Service;


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or


the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content


delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient


value to be the basis for such sales.


E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:


uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or


artistic enterprise;


showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising


restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or


any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.


(For more information about what constitutes a prohibited commercial use, see our FAQ.)


F. If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of the


Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the YouTube website.


G. If you use the YouTube Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates from time to time from


YouTube. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug fixes,


enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit


YouTube to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.


H. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that


accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time than a


human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,


YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole


purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches


or archives of such materials. YouTube reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You


agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the


communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree


not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.



I. In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.


J. YouTube reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.


5. Your Use of Content


In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of Content.

YouTube, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.


B. Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended through the


provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download any Content unless


you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content. You shall not copy, reproduce,


distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior


written consent of YouTube or the respective licensors of the Content. YouTube and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly


granted in and to the Service and the Content.


C. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that prevent or


restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.


D. You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that YouTube is not


responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You further


understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and


you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against YouTube with


respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless YouTube, its owners,


operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the


Service.


6. Your Content and Conduct


A. As a YouTube account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including videos and user comments. You understand


that YouTube does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.


B. You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content on the


Service. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to


publish Content you submit; and you license to YouTube all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights


in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.


C. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to YouTube, you hereby grant


YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare


derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and YouTube's (and its successors' and


affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works


thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive


license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as


permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in video


Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your videos from


the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies


of your videos that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are


perpetual and irrevocable.


D. You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is


subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are


otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant YouTube all of the license rights granted herein.


E. You further agree that you will not submit to the Service any Content or other material that is contrary to the YouTube


Community Guidelines, currently found at http://www.youtube.com/t/community\_guidelines, which may be updated from time to


time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.


F. YouTube does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation,


or advice expressed therein, and YouTube expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. YouTube does


not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and YouTube will remove


all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. YouTube reserves the right to


remove Content without prior notice.


7. Account Termination Policy


A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat


infringer.


B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright


infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without prior


notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation


of these Terms of Service.


8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act


A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a


notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following


information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):


A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is


allegedly infringed;


Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online


site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;


Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be


removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate


the material;


Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number,


and, if available, an electronic mail;


A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the


copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and


A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act


on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

changes. The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") will be posted at http</span>:<span style="background-color: green;">//ie.youtube.com/t/terms</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or made available
