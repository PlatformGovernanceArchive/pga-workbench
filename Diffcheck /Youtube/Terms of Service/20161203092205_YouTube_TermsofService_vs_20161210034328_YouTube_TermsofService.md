8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act


A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof an</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may


submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the


following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):


A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is


allegedly infringed;


Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single


online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;


Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to


be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service


provider to locate the material;


Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone


number, and, if available, an electronic mail;


A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized


by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and


A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized


to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


You may direct copyright infringement notifications to our DMCA Agent at 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, email:


copyright@youtube.com, fax: 650-872-8513. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other


feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to YouTube customer


service through https://support.google.com/youtube. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the


requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.


B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or


that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and


use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright


Agent:


Your physical or electronic signature;


Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which


the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;


A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a


misidentification of the Content; and


Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the


federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person


who provided notification of the alleged infringement.


If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original


complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.


Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the


removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-


notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.

loss of data suffered by you;


B. any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of:

relationship or transaction between you and any advertiser or sponsor whose advertising appears on the Service;

the Service (or any features within the Service);


iii. the deletion of, corruption of, or failure to store, any Content and other communications data maintained or transmitted


by or through your use of the Service;


iv. your failure to provide YouTube with accurate account information;


v. your failure to keep your password or YouTube account details secure and confidential.


13.3 The limitations on YouTube's liability to you in paragraph 13.2 above shall apply whether or not YouTube has been

14. General legal terms


14.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and YouTube and govern your use of the Service and


completely replace any prior agreements between you and YouTube in relation to the Service. All other terms of service that


Google Inc. and any of its subsidiaries may have in place from time to time are expressly excluded from the Terms.


14.2 You agree that YouTube may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,


regular mail, or postings on the Service.


14.3 You agree that if YouTube does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or


which YouTube has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of YouTube's rights


and that those rights or remedies will still be available to YouTube.


14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then


that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms


will continue to be valid and enforceable.


14.5 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which YouTube is a part shall be third party


beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of


the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favour of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third


party beneficiary of the Terms.


14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with YouTube under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and YouTube


agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.


Notwithstanding this, you agree that YouTube shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types


of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.</span>
