<p>authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service</p>
<p></span>(<span style="background-color: green;">su</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ollectively t</span>h<span style="background-color: green;"> as th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> Embeddable Player).</p>

<p>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content</p>
<p>delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of</p>
<p>sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.</p>
<p>E. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:</p>
<p>uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or</p>
<p>artistic enterprise;</p>

<p>foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site</p>
<p>for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,</p>

<p>specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the</p>

<p>A. YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a</p>
<p>repeat infringer.</p>
<p>B. YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright</p>
