<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other</p>
<p>people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can</p>
<p>make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to</p>
<p>make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information</p>
<p>and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<p>Hide examples</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<p>How we use that information.</p>
<p>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and</p>
<p>browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-</p>
<p>time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.</p>

<p>Information we collect</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you</p>
<p>speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which</p>
<p>YouTube videos you might like.</p>
<p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
<p>Information you give us.</p>
<p>Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you</p>
<p>do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with</p>
<p>your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a</p>
<p>publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.</p>
<p>Information we get from your use of our services.</p>
<p>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how</p>
<p>you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and</p>
<p>interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</p>
<p>Device information</p>
<p>Device information</p>
<p>We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device</p>
<p>identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device</p>
<p>identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.</p>
<p>Log information</p>
<p>Log information</p>
<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain</p>
<p>information in server logs. This includes:</p>
<p>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</p>
<p>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and</p>
<p>date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</p>
<p>Internet protocol address.</p>
<p>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser</p>
<p>language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</p>
<p>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.</p>
<p>Location information</p>
<p>Location information</p>
<p>When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use</p>
<p>various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example,</p>
<p>provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
<p>Unique application numbers</p>
<p>Unique application numbers</p>
<p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for</p>
<p>example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or</p>
<p>uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>
<p>Local storage</p>
<p>Local storage</p>
<p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using</p>
<p>mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies</p>
<p>We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service,</p>
<p>and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these</p>
<p>technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as</p>
<p>advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites. Our Google Analytics product helps</p>
<p>businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our</p>
<p>advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the</p>
<p>Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple</p>
<p>sites.</p>
<p>Information we collect when you are signed in to Google, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners,</p>
<p>may be associated with your Google Account. When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as</p>
<p>personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated</p>
<p>with your Google Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>How we use information we collect</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new</p>
<p>ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more</p>
<p>relevant search results and ads.</p>
<p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account.</p>
<p>In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently</p>
<p>across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them</p>
<p>your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>
<p>If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-</p>
<p>party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our</p>
<p>services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing</p>
<p>or visibility settings in your Google Account.</p>
<p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may</p>
<p>use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or</p>
<p>improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the</p>
<p>overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example,</p>
<p>by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing</p>
<p>you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as</p>
<p>those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
<p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such</p>
<p>as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other</p>
<p>Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings,</p>
<p>your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s</p>
<p>services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal</p>
<p>information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Transparency and choice</p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make</p>
<p>meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on</p>
<p>YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit</p>
<p>these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you</p>
<p>use our services while signed-out of your account.</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which</p>
<p>categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising</p>
<p>services.</p>
<p>Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with through your Google Account.</p>
<p>Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.</p>
<p>Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a</p>
<p>cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your</p>
<p>cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Information you share</p>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be</p>
<p>indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing</p>
<p>your content.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Accessing and updating your personal information</p>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is</p>
<p>wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for</p>
<p>legitimate business or legal purposes.</p>
<p>We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because</p>
<p>of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active</p>
<p>servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Information we share</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the</p>
<p>following circumstances applies:</p>
<p>With your consent</p>
<p>With your consent</p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have</p>
<p>your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>With domain administrators</p>
<p>With domain administrators</p>
<p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for G Suite users) then your</p>
<p>domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google</p>
<p>Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:</p>
<p>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.</p>
<p>change your account password.</p>
<p>suspend or terminate your account access.</p>
<p>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</p>
<p>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable</p>
<p>governmental request.</p>
<p>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</p>
<p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
<p>For external processing</p>
<p>For external processing</p>
<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on</p>
<p>our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security</p>
<p>measures.</p>
<p>For legal reasons</p>
<p>For legal reasons</p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-</p>
<p>faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>

<p>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</p>
<p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
<p>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted</p>
<p>by law.</p>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or</p>
<p>connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal</p>
<p>information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different</p>
<p>privacy policy.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Information security</p>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or</p>
<p>destruction of information we hold. In particular:</p>
<p>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p>
<p>We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google</p>
<p>Chrome.</p>
<p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to</p>
<p>guard against unauthorized access to systems.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that</p>
<p>information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may</p>
<p>be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</p>
<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks, including</p>
<p>the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person</p>
<p>who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection</p>
<p>authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your</p>
<p>explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a</p>
