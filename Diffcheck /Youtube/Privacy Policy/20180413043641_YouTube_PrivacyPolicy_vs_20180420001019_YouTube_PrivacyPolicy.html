<p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<p>How we use that information.</p>
<p>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and</p>
<p>browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-</p>
<p>time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.</p>

<p>Transparency and choice</p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make</p>
<p>meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on</p>
<p>YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit</p>
<p>these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">use</p>
<p></span>our services while signed-out of your account.</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which</p>
<p>categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising</p>
<p>services.</p>
<p>Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with through your Google Account.</p>
<p>Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.</p>
<p>Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a</p>
<p>cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your</p>
<p>cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.</p>
