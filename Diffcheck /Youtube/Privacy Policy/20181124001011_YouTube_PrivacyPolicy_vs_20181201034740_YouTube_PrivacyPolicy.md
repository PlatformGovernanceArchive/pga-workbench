</span>outages or troubleshooting issues that you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>report to us. And we use your information to make<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are<span style="background-color: red;"> most</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">most </span>frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.


Develop new services

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>understanding how people organized<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>recommendations, personalized content, and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>customized search results. For example, Security<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Checkup


 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>new apps you might like.


Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>example, if you search for “mountain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what<span style="background-color: red;"> information we use to</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span><span style="background-color: green;">information we use to </span>show you ads by visiting your ad settings.


We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>sexual orientation, or health.


We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>or email, unless you ask us to. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>the flower shop.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to


provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we


analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in

you ask it to translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example,


if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending

Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google
