We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new

relevant search results and ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account.


In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently


across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them


your publicly </span>visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.


If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-


party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>services,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>or visibility<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>settings in your Google Account.


When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may<span style="background-color: red;">


use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">use


</span>your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>improvements.


We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the


overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>by<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing<span style="background-color: red;">


you</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you


</span>tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as<span style="background-color: red;">


those</span> <span style="background-color: green;">those


</span>based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.


Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such<span style="background-color: red;">


as</span> <span style="background-color: green;">as


</span>customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.


We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Google<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings,<span style="background-color: red;">


your</span> <span style="background-color: green;">your


</span>activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s<span style="background-color: red;">


services</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and</span><span style="background-color: green;">services</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and


</span>the ads delivered by Google.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.


Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal


information on a server located outside the country where you live.

<span style="background-color: green;">
</span>Transparency and choice


People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make


meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:


Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on


YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit


these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you<span style="background-color: red;">


use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">use


</span>our services while signed-out of your account.


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which


categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising


services.


Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.


Control who you share information with through your Google Account.


Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.


Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.


You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a


cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your


cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.

</span>we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>legitimate business<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
