<p><strong>YouTube Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated as of March 11, 2009</strong> <strong>(View archived version)</strong></p>
<p>The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google services, including</p>
<p>information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Browsing YouTube</strong> You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You also can contact us</p>
<p>through the YouTube Help Center or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.</p>
<p><strong>Your YouTube Account.</strong> For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching</p>
<p>restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account, including</p>
<p>your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account, additionally,</p>
<p>allows you to access other Google services that require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels, groups and</p>
<p>favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and size of data transfers, and</p>
<p>information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTube (including UI elements, settings). If you are logged</p>
<p>in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure the quality of our service to you, we may place a tag</p>
<p>(also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications with you in order to confirm delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong> Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., video comments, your</p>
<p>profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy includes a unique application</p>
<p>number. This number, and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will be sent to YouTube when</p>
<p>the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.</p>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<p>If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and</p>
<p>functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.</p>
<p>We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We</p>
<p>may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major</p>
<p>YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends you email updates in your</p>
<p>YouTube Account settings page.</p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or</p>
<p>the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing</p>
<p>campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions,</p>
<p>and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p><strong>Information That is Publicly Available</strong></p>
<p>When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be provided to other</p>
<p>users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged into your YouTube Account,</p>
<p>your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have watched.</p>
<p>Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on YouTube,</p>
<p>such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment</p>
<p>on the site.</p>
<p>Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by other</p>
<p>YouTube users or the general public.</p>
<p>You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be</p>
<p>visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube Account channel</p>
<p>page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be aggregated and</p>
<p>shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos, videos you rated and videos that you have</p>
<p>uploaded.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p>If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings at</p>
<p>any time by visiting your account profile page.</p>
<p>You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your YouTube Account</p>
<p>and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that you, as identified</p>
<p>by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and explore</p>
<p>YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may use other Google</p>
<p>services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information</p>
<p>associated with them.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising on YouTube</strong></p>
<p>YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie, as well as other third party ad</p>
<p>serving systems, to do so. We may use a range of information including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage data and other</p>
<p>non-personal information about your computer or device (such as browser type and operating system) to provide you with relevant</p>
<p>advertising. If you are logged into your YouTube Account, we may also show you advertising based on the information you have provided</p>
<p>to us in your YouTube Account.</p>
<p>We use the DoubleClick cookie on YouTube to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other Google</p>
<p>and AdSense partner websites. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests associated with non-personally identifiable online activity,</p>
<p>such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other AdSense partner sites. Advertisers may also serve ads to you based</p>
<p>on previous activity on that advertiser's website. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from your YouTube</p>
<p>Account data, or other personally identifying information in our possession.</p>
<p>You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences Manager for the</p>
<p>DoubleClick cookie. Your ads preferences will be respected across YouTube, AdSense partner sites and Google sites using the</p>
<p>DoubleClick cookie to serve such ads. For more information about interest-based advertising and the Ads Preference Manager see our</p>
<p>FAQ.</p>
<p>You also may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time. If you select the DoubleClick opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your</p>
<p>browser by our ad-serving technology will not be served based on the DoubleClick cookie. Find more information here about opting out</p>
<p>of the DoubleClick cookie.</p>

<p><strong>Upload</strong></p>
<p>Other third-party ad serving companies may display ads on YouTube, provided they comply with our ad serving requirements. YouTube</p>
<p>does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. You should consult the</p>
<p>respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on</p>
<p>how to opt-out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other</p>
<p>advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with YouTube is maintained and dealt with by</p>
<p>YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
