<span style="background-color: red;">our services</span><span style="background-color: green;">�������������������������������</span>

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more

complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.

The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your

privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application,

or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.

<span style="background-color: green;">����������������������������������

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also

choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might

choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. </span>Thi<span style="background-color: red;">ng</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">you create or prov</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">ncl</span><span style="background-color: red;">de to </span>u<span style="background-color: green;">de</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> things like email you write</span>

Your apps, browsers & devices

Your apps, browsers & devices</span>

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like

automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile

network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the

interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time,

and referrer URL of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the

Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically

contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like

your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.

Your location information

Your location information</span>

We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your

Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

GPS

IP address

Sensor data from your device

The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s

location on or off

 using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History

 if you want to create a private map of where

you go with your signed-in devices.

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears

in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may

also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be

displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services,

and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide

advertising and research services on their behalf.

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or

application data caches, databases, and server logs.

Provide personalized services, including content and ads</span>

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and

customized search results. For example, Security Checkup

 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google

Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain

bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what

information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.

We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For

example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your

phone number with the flower shop.

the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use

Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site with

activity from other sites that use our ad services.

Protect Google, our users, and the public

Protect Google, our users, and the public</span>

We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud,

abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to

provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we

analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in

data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases

you ask it to translate.

We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example,

if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending

on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve

Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google

Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:

Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload. You can also delete activity information

saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically

 after a set period of time.

Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.

We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.

And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud

and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or

retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because

of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

California requirements

California requirements

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires specific disclosures for California residents.

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:

We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.

We explain how Google uses information in Why Google collects data.

We explain when Google may share information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information.

The CCPA also provides the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your personal information. And it

be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights.

We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in Your privacy controls. You can exercise

your rights by using these controls, which allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and

download

 a copy of it. When you use them, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account. If you

have questions or requests related to your rights under the CCPA, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google . You can also
