INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS


<span style="background-color: green;">We want you to understand the types of information we


collect as you use our services


We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff


like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the


people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information


Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and


how you manage your privacy controls.


When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique


identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like


maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.


When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which


we treat as personal information.


Things you create or provide to us


When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your


name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to


your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us


with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.


We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.


This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and


spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.


Information we collect as you use our services


Your apps, browsers & devices



We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google


services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your


screen if your battery runs low.


The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and


settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone


number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of


your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system


activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.


We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for


example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic


updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts


Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This


information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps


you've installed.


Your activity


We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like


recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:


Terms you search for


Videos you watch


Views and interactions with content and ads


Voice and audio information when you use audio features


Purchase activity


People with whom you communicate or share content



Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services


Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account


If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect


telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number,


forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information,


and types of calls.


You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your


account.


Go to Google Account


Your location information


We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer


features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near


you.


Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:


GPS


IP address


Sensor data from your device


Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and


Bluetooth-enabled devices


The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For


example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off


 using the device’s settings app.


You can also turn on Location History


 if you want to create a private map of where you go with


your signed-in devices.


In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible


sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine



sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine


may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also


collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us


with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who


provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from


advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.


We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local


storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.


WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA


We use data to build better services


We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:


Provide our services


We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order


to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.


Maintain & improve our services



We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking


outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make


improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most


frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.


Develop new services


We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example,


understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us


design and launch Google Photos.


Provide personalized services, including content and ads


We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing


recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security


Checkup


 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play


uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to


suggest new apps you might like.


Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.


For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when



you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we


use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.


We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion,


sexual orientation, or health.


We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your


name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop


and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone


number with the flower shop.


Go to Ad Settings


Measure performance


We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For


example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.


And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the


performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google


Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics


customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that


use our ad services.


Communicate with you


We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example,


we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your


Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or


improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in



order to help solve any issues you might be facing.


Protect Google, our users, and the public


We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes


detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that


could harm Google, our users, or the public.


We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use


automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search


results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze


your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use


algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people


communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to


translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the


purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you


might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your


account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal


information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may


show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This


helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.


We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this


Privacy Policy.



YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS


You have choices regarding the information we collect


and how it's used


This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also

 allows you to give someone else access to parts of your


Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.


There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in


to a Google Account, including:


Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google


has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies


from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to


function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.


Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we


collect. For example, you can modify location settings


 on your Android device.



SHARING YOUR </span>INFORMATION<span style="background-color: green;">


When you share your information


Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how


you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep


your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become


accessible through search engines, including</span> G<span style="background-color: red;">OO</span><span style="background-color: green;">oogle Search.


When you’re signed in and interact with some </span>G<span style="background-color: red;">L</span><span style="background-color: green;">oogle services, like leaving comments on a


YouTube video or reviewing a song in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.


We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting


.


When Google shares your information


We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside


of Google except in the following cases:


With your consent


We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if


you use Google Home to make a reservation


 through a booking service, we’ll get your


permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your


explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.


With domain administrators


If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services (like G Suite), your


domain administrator


 and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google


Account. They may be able to:


Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email


View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install


Change your account password


Suspend or terminate your account access


Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal


process, or enforceable governmental request


Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings


For external processing



We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to


process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any


other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers


to help us with customer support.


For legal reasons


We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access,


use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:


Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.


We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments


in our Transparency Report


.


</span>E<span style="background-color: green;">nforce</span> <span style="background-color: red;">COLL</span><span style="background-color: green;">applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.


Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.


Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as


required or permitted by law.


We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like


publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly


to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect


information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their


own cookies or similar technologies.


If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the


confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal


information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
