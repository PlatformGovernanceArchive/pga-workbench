<p></span>Privacy Policy</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">�</span><span style="background-color: green;"></span></p>
<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
<p>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</p>
<p>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</p>
<p>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Maps</p>
<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>up for a Google Account if you want to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>create and manage content like emails and photos, or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you’re signed<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>You can also choose to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what<span style="background-color: red;"> we collect and how your</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">we collect and how your </span>information is used.</p>
<p>To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>definitions for key terms. And if you have any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>questions about this Privacy Policy, you can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">We want you to understand the types of information we</p>
<p>collect as you use our services</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff</p>
<p>like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the</p>
<p>people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information</p>
<p>Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and</p>
<p>how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
<p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique</p>
<p>identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like</p>
<p>maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which</p>
<p>we treat as personal information.</p>
<p>Things you create or provide to us</p>
<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your</p>
<p>name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to</p>
<p>your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us</p>
<p>with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>
<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.</p>
<p>This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and</p>
<p>spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Information we collect as you use our services</p>
<p>Your apps, browsers &amp; devices</p>
<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google</p>
<p>services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your</p>
<p>screen if your battery runs low.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and</p>
<p>settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone</p>
<p>number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of</p>
<p>your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system</p>
<p>activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for</p>
<p>example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic</p>
<p>updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts</p>
<p>Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This</p>
<p>information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps</p>
<p>you've installed.</p>
<p>Your activity</p>
<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like</p>
<p>recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:</p>
<p>Terms you search for</p>
<p>Videos you watch</p>
<p>Views and interactions with content and ads</p>
<p>Voice and audio information when you use audio features</p>
<p>Purchase activity</p>
<p>People with whom you communicate or share content</p>
<p>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</p>
<p>Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account</p>
<p>If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect</p>
<p>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number,</p>
<p>forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information,</p>
<p>and types of calls.</p>
<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>Go to Google Account</p>
<p>Your location information</p>
<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer</p>
<p>features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>
<p>GPS</p>
<p>IP address</p>
<p>Sensor data from your device</p>
<p>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and</p>
<p>Bluetooth-enabled devices</p>
<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For</p>
<p>example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off</p>
<p>using the device’s settings app.</p>
<p>You can also turn on Location History</p>
<p>if you want to create a private map of where you go with</p>
<p>your signed-in devices.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible</p>
<p>sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine</p>
<p>sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine</p>
<p>may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also</p>
<p>collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us</p>
<p>with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who</p>
<p>provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from</p>
<p>advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local</p>
<p>storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.</p>
<p>WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA</p>
<p>We use data to build better services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Provide our services</p>
<p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order</p>
<p>to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
<p>Maintain &amp; improve our services</p>
<p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking</p>
<p>outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make</p>
<p>improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most</p>
<p>frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
<p>Develop new services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example,</p>
<p>understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us</p>
<p>design and launch Google Photos.</p>
<p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</p>
<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing</p>
<p>recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security</p>
<p>Checkup</p>
<p>provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play</p>
<p>uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to</p>
<p>suggest new apps you might like.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.</p>
<p>For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when</p>
<p>you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we</p>
<p>use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
<p>We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion,</p>
<p>sexual orientation, or health.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your</p>
<p>name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop</p>
<p>and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone</p>
<p>number with the flower shop.</p>
<p>Go to Ad Settings</p>
<p>Measure performance</p>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For</p>
<p>example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.</p>
<p>And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the</p>
<p>performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google</p>
<p>Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics</p>
<p>customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that</p>
<p>use our ad services.</p>
<p>Communicate with you</p>
<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example,</p>
<p>we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your</p>
<p>Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or</p>
<p>improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in</p>
<p>order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
<p>Protect Google, our users, and the public</p>
<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes</p>
<p>detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that</p>
<p>could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use</p>
<p>automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search</p>
<p>results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze</p>
<p>your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use</p>
<p>algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people</p>
<p>communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to</p>
<p>translate.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the</p>
<p>purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you</p>
<p>might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your</p>
<p>account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal</p>
<p>information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may</p>
<p>show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This</p>
<p>helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this</p>
<p>Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS</p>
<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect</p>
<p>and how it's used</p>

<p>Watch History</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ad Settings: Manage</p>
<p>your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on</p>
<p>sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.</p>
<p>Exporting, removing &amp; deleting your information</p>

<p>There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in</p>
<p>to a Google Account, including:</p>
<p>Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google</p>
<p>has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies</p>
<p>from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to</p>
<p>function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.</p>
<p>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we</p>
<p>collect. For example, you can modify location settings</p>
<p>on your Android device.</p>

<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to</p>
<p>our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand</p>
<p>the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use</p>
<p>Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other</p>
<p>sites that use our ad services.</p>

<p>upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve</p>
<p>any issues you might be facing.</p>

<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud,</p>
<p>abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to</p>
<p>provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we</p>
<p>analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in</p>
<p>data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases</p>
<p>you ask it to translate.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example,</p>
<p>if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending</p>
<p>on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve</p>
<p>Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google</p>
<p>Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
