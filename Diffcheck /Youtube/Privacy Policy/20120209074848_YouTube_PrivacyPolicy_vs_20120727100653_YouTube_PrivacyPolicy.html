<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new</p>
<p>content</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more</p>
<p>relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want</p>
<p>you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Our </span>P<span style="background-color: red;">lease see ou</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ivacy Policy explains:</p>
<p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<p>How we use that information.</p>
<p>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about</p>
<p>these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know</p>
<p>our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.</p>

<p>things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.</p>
<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>

When you do, we’ll ask for personal</p>
<p>information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer,</p>
<p>we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.</p>
<p></span><em><span style="background-color: green;"></em>Information we get from your use of our services.** We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like</p>
<p>when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device information</strong></p>
<p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and</p>
<p>mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google</p>
<p>Account.</p>
<p><strong>Log information</strong></p>
<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server</p>
<p>logs. This may include:</p>
<p>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</p>
<p>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of</p>
<p>calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</p>
<p>Internet protocol address.</p>
<p>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time</p>
<p>of your request and referral URL.</p>
<p>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.</p>
<p><strong>Location information</strong></p>
<p>When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals</p>
<p>sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may,</p>
<p>for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>

<p><strong>Your YouTube Account.</strong> For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or</p>
<p>watching restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create</p>
<p>an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>A Google Account, additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,</p>

<p>offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites.</p>
<p><strong>How we use information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google</p>
<p>and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>

<p>When</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email</p>
<p>address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our</p>
<p>services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you</p>
<p>tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation</p>
<p>or health.</p>
<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to</p>
<p>make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information</p>
<p>unless we have your opt-in consent.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server</p>
<p>located outside the country where you live.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency and choice</strong></p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how</p>
<p>it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your ads preferences, such as which categories might interest you, using the Ads Preferences Manager. You can also opt out of</p>
<p>certain Google advertising services here.</p>
<p>Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with.</p>
<p>Take information out of many of our services.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not</p>
<p>remember your language preferences.</p>

<p>Uses</p>
<p>If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features</p>
<p>and functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.</p>
<p>We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your</p>
<p>consent. We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as</p>
<p>notifying you of major YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends</p>
<p>you email updates in your YouTube Account settings page.</p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during</p>
<p>your visit or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed;</p>
<p>and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p>Information That is Publicly Available</p>
<p>When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be</p>
<p>provided to other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged</p>
<p>into your YouTube Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have</p>
<p>watched.</p>
<p>Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on</p>
<p>YouTube, such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a</p>
<p>message or comment on the site.</p>
<p>Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be</p>
<p>viewed by other YouTube users or the general public.</p>
<p>You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that</p>
<p>will be visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube</p>
<p>Account channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users</p>
<p>and may be aggregated and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos,</p>
<p>videos you rated and videos that you have uploaded.</p>
<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy</p>
<p>settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.</p>
<p>You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your</p>
<p>YouTube Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users</p>
<p>may see that you, as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and</p>
<p>explore YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may</p>
<p>use other Google services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your</p>
<p>personal information associated with them.</p>
<p>Advertising on YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie, as well as other third</p>
<p>YouTube Privacy Notice</span></p>
<p><strong>A<span style="background-color: red;">bo</span><span style="background-color: green;">ccessing and </span>u<span style="background-color: green;">pda</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ing your personal information</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you</p>
<p>ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your</p>
<p>personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or</p>
<p>fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning</p>
<p>information residing on backup tapes).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to</p>
<p>maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from</p>
<p>our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
<p><strong>Information we share</strong></p>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances</p>
<p>apply:</p>
<p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We</p>
<p>require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p><strong>With domain administrators</strong></p>
<p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and</p>
<p>resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other</p>
<p>data). Your domain administrator may be able to:</p>
<p>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.</p>
<p>change your account password.</p>
<p>suspend or terminate your account access.</p>
<p>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</p>
<p>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p>
<p>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</p>
<p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
<p><strong>For external processing</strong></p>
<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in</p>
<p>compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access,</p>
<p>use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p>
<p>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</p>
<p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
<p>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For</p>
<p>example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected</p>
<p>users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information security</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we</p>
<p>hold. In particular:</p>
<p>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p>
<p>We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized</p>
<p>access to systems.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process</p>
<p>it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these</p>
<p>obligations.</span></p>

<p>information here about opting out of the DoubleClick cookie.</p>

<p>shared with YouTube is maintained and dealt with by YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
