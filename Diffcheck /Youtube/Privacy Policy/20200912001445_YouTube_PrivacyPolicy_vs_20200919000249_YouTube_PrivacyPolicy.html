<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
<p>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</p>
<p>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</p>
<p>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</p>
<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want</p>
<p>to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services</p>
<p>when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also</p>
<p>choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to</p>
<p>control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>
<p>To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have</p>
<p>any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us</p>

<p>INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS</p>
<p>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our</p>
<p>services</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more</p>
<p>complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might</p>
<p>like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage</p>
<p>your privacy controls.</p>
<p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser,</p>
<p>application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>
<p>Things you create or provide to us</p>
<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also</p>
<p>choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might</p>
<p>choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might</p>
<p>choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>
<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you</p>
<p>write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Information we collect as you use our services</p>
<p>Your apps, browsers &amp; devices</p>
<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like</p>
<p>automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile</p>
<p>network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the</p>
<p>interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date,</p>
<p>time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from</p>
<p>the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device</p>
<p>periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information</p>
<p>includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.</p>
<p>Your activity</p>
<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.</p>
<p>The activity information we collect may include:</p>
<p>Terms you search for</p>
<p>Videos you watch</p>
<p>Views and interactions with content and ads</p>
<p>Voice and audio information when you use audio features</p>
<p>Purchase activity</p>
<p>People with whom you communicate or share content</p>
<p>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</p>
<p>Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account</p>
<p>If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your</p>
<p>phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of</p>
<p>calls, routing information, and types of calls.</p>
<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.</p>
<p>Go to Google Account</p>
<p>Your location information</p>
<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your</p>
<p>weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>
<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>
<p>GPS</p>
<p>IP address</p>
<p>Sensor data from your device</p>
<p>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices</p>
<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android</p>
<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android</p>
<p>device’s location on or off</p>
<p>using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History</p>
<p>if you want to create a private</p>
<p>map of where you go with your signed-in devices.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name</p>
<p>appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your</p>
<p>name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information</p>
<p>about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.</p>
<p>We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage</p>
<p>or application data caches, databases, and server logs.</p>
<p>WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA</p>
<p>We use data to build better services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Provide our services</p>
<p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share</p>
<p>content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
<p>Maintain &amp; improve our services</p>
<p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that</p>
<p>you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search</p>
<p>terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
<p>Develop new services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized</p>
<p>their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
<p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</p>
<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and</p>
<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and</p>
<p>customized search results. For example, Security Checkup</p>
<p>provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And</p>
<p>Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you</p>
<p>might like.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for</p>
<p>“mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can</p>
<p>control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
<p>We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For</p>
<p>example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your</p>
<p>phone number with the flower shop.</p>
<p>Go to Ad Settings</p>
<p>Measure performance</p>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits</p>
<p>to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers</p>
<p>understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit</p>
<p>sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with</p>
<p>activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
<p>Communicate with you</p>
<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we</p>
<p>detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about</p>
<p>upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help</p>
<p>solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
<p>Protect Google, our users, and the public</p>
<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to</p>
<p>fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to</p>
<p>provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And</p>
<p>we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize</p>
<p>patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns</p>
<p>in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For</p>
<p>example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.</p>
<p>Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to</p>
<p>improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google</p>
<p>Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS</p>
<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>
<p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup</p>

<p>If you’re a G Suite user, control whom you share information with through your account on Google+.</p>
<p>Go to Information You Share</p>
<p>Ways to review &amp; update your information</p>
<p><strong>My Activity</strong></p>
<p>My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits</p>
<p>to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.</p>
<p>Go to My Activity</p>
<p><strong>Google Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>Google Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard</p>
<p><strong>Your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Manage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.</p>
<p>Go to Personal Info</p>
<p>When you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:</p>
<p>Signed-out search personalization: Choose</p>
<p>whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and</p>
<p>recommendations.</p>
<p>YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History</p>
<p>and your YouTube Watch History</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ad Settings: Manage</p>
<p>your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google</p>
<p>to show ads.</p>
<p>Exporting, removing &amp; deleting your information</p>
<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>
<p>Export your data</p>
<p>You can also request to remove content</p>
<p>from specific Google services based on applicable law.</p>
<p>To delete your information, you can:</p>
<p>Delete your content from specific Google services</p>
<p>Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity</p>
<p>Delete specific Google products</p>
<p>, including your information associated with those products</p>
<p>Delete your entire Google Account</p>
<p>Delete your information</p>
<p>And finally, Inactive Account Manager</p>
<p>allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re</p>
<p>unexpectedly unable to use your account.</p>
<p>There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:</p>
<p>Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You</p>
<p>can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on</p>
<p>cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.</p>
<p>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify</p>
<p>location settings</p>
<p>on your Android device.</p>
<p>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>When you share your information</p>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can</p>
<p>share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly,</p>
<p>your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play,</p>
<p>your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared</p>
<p>endorsements setting</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When Google shares your information</p>
<p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following</p>
<p>cases:</p>
<p>With your consent</p>
<p>We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a</p>
<p>reservation</p>
<p>through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>With domain administrators</p>
<p>If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services (like G Suite), your domain administrator</p>
<p>and resellers who</p>
<p>manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:</p>
<p>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</p>
<p>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install</p>
<p>Change your account password</p>
<p>Suspend or terminate your account access</p>
<p>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental</p>
<p>request</p>
<p>Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings</p>
<p>For external processing</p>
<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our</p>
<p>instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example,</p>
<p>we use service providers to help us with customer support.</p>
<p>For legal reasons</p>
<p>We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the</p>
<p>information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<p>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number</p>
<p>and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</p>
<p>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>
<p>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or</p>
<p>rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific</p>
<p>partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or</p>
<p>similar technologies.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information</p>
<p>and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</p>
<p>We build security into our services to protect your information</p>
<p>All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from</p>
<p>maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something</p>
<p>risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.</p>
<p>We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold,</p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit</p>
<p>We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing</p>
<p>, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification</p>
<p>to help you protect your</p>
<p>account</p>
<p>We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent</p>
<p>unauthorized access to our systems</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to</p>
<p>process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if</p>
<p>they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>EXPORTING &amp; DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google</p>
<p>Account at any time</p>
<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>
<p>Export your data</p>

<p>, including your information associated with those products</p>
<p>Delete your entire Google Account</p>
<p>Delete your information</p>
<p>RETAINING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:</p>
<p>Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload. You can also delete activity</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically</p>
<p>after a set period of time.</p>
<p>Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.</p>
<p>We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.</p>
<p>And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security,</p>
<p>fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.</p>
<p>When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or</p>
<p>retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because</p>
<p>of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.</p>
<p>You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.</p>
<p>COMPLIANCE &amp; COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS</p>
<p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</p>
<p>Data transfers</p>
<p>We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you</p>
<p>live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your</p>
<p>information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating</p>
<p>to the transfer of data, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
<p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the</p>
<p>appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your</p>
<p>data that we cannot resolve with you directly.</p>
<p>California requirements</p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires specific disclosures for California residents.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:</p>
<p>We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.</p>
<p>We explain how Google uses information in Why Google collects data.</p>
<p>We explain when Google may share information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information.</p>
<p>The CCPA also provides the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your personal information.</p>
<p>And it gives you the right to access your information and request that Google delete that information. Finally, the CCPA provides the</p>
<p>right to not be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
<p>We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in Your privacy controls. You can</p>
<p>exercise your rights by using these controls, which allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export</p>
<p>and download</p>
<p>a copy of it. When you use them, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account.</p>
<p>If you have questions or requests related to your rights under the CCPA, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The CCPA requires a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the</p>
<p>information in this Privacy Policy.</p>
