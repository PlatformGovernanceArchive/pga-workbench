How we use information we collect


We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>ones, and to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more<span style="background-color: red;"> relevant search results and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">relevant search results and </span>ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>In addition, we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>across all our services. If other users<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your name and photo.


If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-<span style="background-color: red;">party applications</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">party applications </span>connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services, including displaying in ads and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>or visibility settings in your Google Account.


When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may<span style="background-color: red;"> use your email</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">use your email </span>address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>improvements.


We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>overall quality of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>by saving your language<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>you tailored ads, we will not associate an<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.


Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>as customized<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.


We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Google services – for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings,<span style="background-color: red;"> your activity on other sites and apps</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">your activity on other sites and apps </span>may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services and the ads delivered by Google.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.


Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal<span style="background-color: red;"> information on a</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">information on a </span>server located outside the country where you live.

People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make<span style="background-color: red;"> meaningful choices</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">meaningful choices </span>about how it is used. For example, you can:


Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>YouTube or past<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use our services while signed-out of your account.


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which<span style="background-color: red;"> categories might</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">categories might </span>interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services.


Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.


Control who you share information with through your Google Account.


Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.


Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.

</span>cookie is being set<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">



</span>by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>cookies are disabled. For example, we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>may not remember your language preferences.

</span>search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>legitimate business or legal purposes.


We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
