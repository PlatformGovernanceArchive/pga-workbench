<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new</p>
<p>content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you<span style="background-color: red;"> more</span></p>

<p><strong></span>sharing with others quicker and easier<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>. As you use our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>services, we want<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<p>How we use that information.</p>
<p>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about</p>
<p>these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know</p>
<p>our practices – and if you have any questions consult this page.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex</p>
<p>things like which <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>ads you’ll find most useful<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> or <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>the people who matter most to you online<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>.</p>
<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal</p>
<p>information, like your name, email address, telephone number or <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>credit card<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer,</p>
<p>we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.</p>
<p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We may <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>collect information<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> about the services that you use and how you use them,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>like<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>view and interact with our ads<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> and content. This information includes:</p>
<p><strong>Device information</strong></p>
<p>We may collect <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>device-specific information<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong>Log information</strong></p>
<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server</p>
<p>logs. This may include:</p>
<p>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</p>
<p>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of</p>
<p>calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</p>
<p>Internet protocol address.</p>
<p>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time</p>
<p>of your request and referral URL.</p>
<p>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.</p>
<p><strong>Location information</strong></p>
<p>When you use a location-enabled Google service, we <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>may collect and process information about your actual location<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>, like GPS<span style="background-color: red;"> signals</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">signals </span>sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>that may,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
<p><strong>Unique application numbers</strong></p>
<p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating</p>
<p>system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service</p>
<p>periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>
<p><strong>Local storage</strong></p>
<p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web</p>
<p>storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong></p>
<p>We <span style="background-color: green;">and our partners </span>use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include<span style="background-color: red;"> sending one or more</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">sending one or more </span>cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you<span style="background-color: red;"> interact with services we</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">interact with services we </span>offer to our partners, such as <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>advertising services<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> or Google features that may appear on other sites.</p>
<p><strong>How we use information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>develop new ones<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>, and to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>protect<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></strong></p>
<p>**</span>Google<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>and</span> <span style="background-color: red;">our</span><span style="background-color: green;">and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">o</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">se</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> u</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">ers**</span>. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
<p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may</p>
<p>replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have</p>
<p>your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>
<p>When you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email</p>
<p>address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>improve your user experience<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> and the overall quality of our</p>
<p>services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you</p>
<p>tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation</p>
<p>or health.</p>
<p>We may <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> –<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>for example <span style="background-color: red;">to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>to </span>make it easier to share things with people you know<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>identifiable information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>unless we have your opt-in consent.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server</p>
<p>located outside the country where you live.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency and choice</strong></p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how</p>
<p>it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using</p>
<p>Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.</p>
<p>Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with.</p>
<p>Take information out of many of our services.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that many of our services <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>may not function properly<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not</p>
<p>remember your language preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Information you share</strong></p>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search</p>
<p>engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>sharing<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>removing your content<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing and updating your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>access to your personal information<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you</p>
<p>ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your</p>
<p>personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or</p>
<p>fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning</p>
<p>information residing on backup systems).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to</p>
<p>maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from</p>
<p>our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
<p><strong>Information we share</strong></p>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances</p>
<p>applies:</p>
<p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We</p>
<p>require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p><strong>With domain administrators</strong></p>
<p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and</p>
<p>resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other</p>
<p>data). Your domain administrator may be able to:</p>
<p>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.</p>
<p>change your account password.</p>
<p>suspend or terminate your account access.</p>
<p>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</p>
<p>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>legal process or enforceable governmental request<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>.</p>
<p>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</p>
<p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
<p><strong>For external processing</strong></p>
<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in</p>
<p>compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access,</p>
<p>use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p>
<p>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</p>
<p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
<p>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong></span>We may share aggregated<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span>, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>example, we may share information publicly <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong></span>to show trends<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></span> about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected</p>
<p>users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information security</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we</p>
<p>hold. In particular:</p>
<p>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p>
<p>We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized</p>
<p>access to systems.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process</p>
<p>it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these</p>
<p>obligations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Whe</span><span style="background-color: red;">Applicatio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;"> this Privacy Policy applies</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our</p>
<p>advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in</p>
<p>search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information</p>
<p>practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and</p>
<p>offer relevant ads.</p>

<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written</p>
<p>complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data</p>
<p>protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post</p>
<p>any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services,</p>
<p>email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
