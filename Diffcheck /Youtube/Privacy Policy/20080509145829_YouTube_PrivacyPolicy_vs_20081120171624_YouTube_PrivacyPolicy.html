<p><strong>YouTube Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated as of July 21, 2008</strong></p>
<p>The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google</p>
<p>services, including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to</p>
<p>YouTube. To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use YouTube, you should read this policy and the</p>
<p>Google Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Account Activity.</strong> You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You</p>
<p>can also contact us about a particular video without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account.</p>
<p><strong>Account-Related Activity.</strong> Certain other activities on YouTube—like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging</p>
<p>videos, or watching restricted videos—require you to have a YouTube Account or a Google Account. We ask for some</p>
<p>personal information when you create a YouTube Account or a Google Account, including your email address and a</p>
<p>password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account allows you to access</p>
<p>many of our services that require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We may record information about your usage, such as when you use YouTube, the channels,</p>
<p>groups, and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the frequency and</p>
<p>size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in YouTube (including UI elements, settings, and</p>
<p>other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs</p>
<p>(a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTM</span>L<span style="background-color: red;">og</span><span style="background-color: green;">-based</span> <span style="background-color: green;">emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong> Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion</p>
<p>boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be</p>
<p>collected and used by others.</p>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>

<p>messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to</p>
<p>opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative</p>
<p>purposes (such as notifying you of major YouTube Site changes or for customer service purposes).</p>
<p>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as</p>
<p>anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and</p>
<p>design of the YouTube Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,</p>

<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Information That is Publicly Available</strong></p>

<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>YouTube allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the YouTube</p>
<p>Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and</p>
<p>links that appear on the YouTube Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use</p>
<p>other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to</p>
<p>personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
<p>YouTube does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your</p>
<p>consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please</p>
<p>note that if an advertiser asks YouTube to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or</p>
<p>audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that</p>
<p>advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The</p>
<p>advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the YouTube Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad</p>
<p>(but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more</p>
<p>information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply</p>
<p>to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers</p>
<p>subsequently shared with YouTube is maintained and dealt with by YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
