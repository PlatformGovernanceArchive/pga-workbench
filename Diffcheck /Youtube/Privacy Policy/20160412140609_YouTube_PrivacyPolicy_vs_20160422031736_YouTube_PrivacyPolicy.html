<p>already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as</p>
<p>your name and photo.</p>
<p>If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google </span>or on third-party<span style="background-color: red;"> applications</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">applications </span>connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including<span style="background-color: red;"> displaying in ads and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">displaying in ads and </span>other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Account.</p>
<p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email</p>
<p>address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality<span style="background-color: red;"> of</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">of </span>our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language</p>
<p>preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate<span style="background-color: red;"> an</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">an </span>identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>health.</p>
<p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized</p>
<p>search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for</p>
<p>example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally</p>
<p>identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information<span style="background-color: red;"> on a</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">on a </span>server located outside the country where you live.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Transparency and choice</p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful<span style="background-color: red;"> choices</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">choices </span>about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past</p>
<p>searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage<span style="background-color: red;"> whether</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">whether </span>certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your account.</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might</p>
<p>interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.</p>
<p>Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with through your Google Account.</p>
<p>Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.</p>
<p>Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being<span style="background-color: red;"> set</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">set </span>by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>example, we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>may not remember your language preferences.</p>

<p>Information you share</p>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by</p>
<p>search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Accessing and updating your personal information</p>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to</p>
<p>give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>When<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system<span style="background-color: red;"> or</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or </span>fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests<span style="background-color: red;"> concerning</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">concerning </span>information residing on backup systems).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you<span style="background-color: red;"> delete</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">delete </span>information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove<span style="background-color: red;"> information from</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">information from </span>our backup systems.</p>

<p>Information we share</p>

<p>With domain administrators</p>
<p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain</p>
<p>administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information</p>
<p>(including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:</p>

<p>suspend or terminate your account access.</p>
<p>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</p>
