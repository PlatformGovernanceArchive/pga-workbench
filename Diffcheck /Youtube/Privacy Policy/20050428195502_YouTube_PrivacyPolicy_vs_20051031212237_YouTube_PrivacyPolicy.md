How to maintain the accuracy of your information.


The Details 


In general, you may visit our Site and access information while not revealing any inpidual user information other than


Technology Related Information (defined below). If you upload content to this Site, the content will be governed by the Terms of


Use and any other terms or conditions on the upload pages. The types of inpidual user information collected in the registration


process may include your name, contact information, other PII and other information volunteered by you. 


YouTube collects PII when you register with YouTube, when you visit YouTube pages and when you deliver communications or


content to the Site. YouTube may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business


associates or otherwise. Without limitation, information collected, including PII, may be used by YouTube for internal research


purposes, marketing, promotions and public relations, subject only to the terms of our privacy policy. 


YouTube will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise communicate your PII to any third party, other than YouTube's parent,


subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of (i) their employees or (ii) vendors and contractors operating under confidentiality


agreements and subject to YouTube's privacy policy, unless you give YouTube permission to do so, except as set forth in this


privacy policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, YouTube may disclose any information you provide if


required to do so by law or pursuant to a request by law enforcement or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is


necessary to (1) comply with the law or with the legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of YouTube or third


parties; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or legal rights ("Mandatory Disclosures"). As we develop our


business, we may buy or sell assets or change our name or form of entity, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal


information may be one of the transferred assets; provided, however, we will not sell or transfer PII except subject to the terms


of our privacy policy. For instance, in the event that YouTube is acquired by another company, your PII may be part of the assets


transferred to the acquiring party. YouTube will notify you before PII about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. The


collected information may be provided in the aggregate to third parties, including potential business partners and advertisers,


but this information is not linked to any PII before it is disclosed unless YouTube has obtained your consent. 


To help administer our Site and provide a positive experience while visiting our Site, YouTube does collect technology-related


information. "Technology-Related Information" may include, but is not limited to the following: source</span> IP address<span style="background-color: green;"> at the time you send a media file to us. Other information such


as your phone number and address is not collected.

it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to


your interests. YouTube may set and access YouTube "cookies" on your computer. YouTube lets other companies that show


advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers or other companies do not


have access to YouTube's cookies. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.


YouTube has no control over the information collected from or about you by any third party after you have left the Site. By clicking


on links to other websites, advertisers and other third parties, you are leaving the Site. Once you have left the Site, YouTube


does not control the data collection and privacy practices, or other activities, of any third party linked to this Site and YouTube


assumes no liability and is not responsible for any practices of such third party websites. 


Data Security 


YouTube endeavors to ensure the commercially reasonable protection of user's PII. We have implemented security measures


to protect PII collected on our Site against loss, misuse or alteration. However, the Internet is an open system and technology


and human operators are not infallible. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that the inpidual user information you


have transmitted, including PII, will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed. We cannot ensure


or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet, and we accept no liability for any unintentional


disclosure. 


Changes to the Privacy Policy 


As a user of the Site, please understand that our privacy policy may change from time to time. If we decide to make any material



changes, we will post these changes on the Site. If, at any point, we decide to use PII in a manner different than what was


stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users of this change by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we


use their information in this different manner. YouTube will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which


the information was collected unless you agree otherwise.
