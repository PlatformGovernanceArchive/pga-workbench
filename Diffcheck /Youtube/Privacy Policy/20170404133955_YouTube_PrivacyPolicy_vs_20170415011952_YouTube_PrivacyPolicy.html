<p>Information we collect</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more</p>
<p>complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.</p>
<p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
<p>Information you give us.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Information you give us.</span> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for</p>
<p>personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take</p>
<p>full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include</p>
<p>your name and photo.</p>
<p>Information we get from your use of our services.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>when</span> <span style="background-color: green;">when</p>
<p></span>that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Local storage</span></p>
<p>Local storage</p>
<p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as</p>
<p>browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Cookies and similar technologies</p>
<p></span>We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may</p>
<p>include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>How we use information we collect</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to</p>
<p>protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and</p>
<p></span>ads.</p>
<p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition,<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we</p>
<p></span>may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>information, such as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your name and photo.</p>
<p>If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>applications</span> <span style="background-color: green;">applications</p>
<p></span>connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>displaying</span> <span style="background-color: red;">in a</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">i</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">pl</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">yi</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">g</span> <span style="background-color: green;">in ads and</p>
<p></span>other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Account.</p>
<p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email</p>
<p>address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>of</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of</p>
<p></span>our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language</p>
<p>preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>an</span> <span style="background-color: green;">an</p>
<p></span>identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>health.</p>
<p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized</p>
<p>search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for</p>
<p>example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>apps</span> <span style="background-color: green;">apps</p>
<p></span>may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>on</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">on</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a</p>

<p>Transparency and choice</p>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>choices</span> <span style="background-color: green;">choices</p>
<p></span>about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<p>Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past</p>
<p>searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>whether</span> <span style="background-color: green;">whether</p>
<p></span>certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>your account.</p>
<p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</p>
<p>View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might</p>
<p>interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising services.</p>
<p>Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.</p>
<p>Control who you share information with through your Google Account.</p>
<p>Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.</p>
<p>Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</p>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>set</span> <span style="background-color: green;">set</p>
<p></span>by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>example, we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>may not remember your language preferences.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Information you share</p>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by</p>
<p>search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.</p>
<p>Back to top</p>
<p>Accessing and updating your personal information</p>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to</p>
<p>give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>When<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>or</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or</p>
<p></span>fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>concerning</span> <span style="background-color: green;">concerning</p>
<p></span>information residing on backup systems).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>delete</span> <span style="background-color: green;">delete</p>
<p></span>information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>W<span style="background-color: green;">ith your consent</p>
<p>W</span>e will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do</p>

<p>For legal reasons</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">For legal reasons</p>
<p></span>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that</p>

<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For</p>
<p>example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>Information security</p>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of</p>
<p>information we hold. In particular:</p>
<p>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p>
<p>We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against</p>
<p>unauthorized access to systems.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
