YouTube Pri</span>vacy<span style="background-color: green;">**</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Notice</span>


**Updated as of December 8, 2010**


The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google services,


including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to YouTube.


Personal Information


**Browsing YouTube** You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You also can


contact us through the YouTube Help Center or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.


**Your YouTube Account.** For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching


restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account,


including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account,


additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.


**Usage Information.** When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,<span style="background-color: red;"> groups</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">groups </span>and favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and size of<span style="background-color: red;"> data</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">data </span>transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTube (including UI elements,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>settings).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure the quality of our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>service to you,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>with you in order<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to confirm delivery.


**Content Uploaded to Site.** Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., video comments,<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">your </span>profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy includes a unique<span style="background-color: red;"> application</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">application </span>number. This number, and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will be sent to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>YouTube when<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.


Uses


If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and


functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.


We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent.


We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major


YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends you email updates in your


YouTube Account settings page.


We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your<span style="background-color: red;"> visit</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">visit </span>or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our


marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries,


submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.


Information That is Publicly Available


When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be provided to


other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged into your YouTube


Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have watched.


Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>YouTube,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a message<span style="background-color: red;"> or comment</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">or comment </span>on the site.


Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by


other YouTube users or the general public.


You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be


visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube Account<span style="background-color: red;"> channel</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">channel </span>page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be<span style="background-color: red;"> aggregated and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">aggregated and </span>shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos, videos you rated and<span style="background-color: red;"> videos that you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">videos that you </span>have uploaded.


Your Choices


If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings<span style="background-color: red;"> at</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">at </span>any time by visiting your account profile page.


You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your YouTube


Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that you,


as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.


You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and explore


YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may use other Google


services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information


associated with them.

<span style="background-color: green;">relevant </span>advertising. While you are logged in or logged out of your YouTube Account, we may also show you advertising based on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other AdSense partner sites.


Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser's website or based on non-personally identifiable


information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from your YouTube Account data, or<span style="background-color: red;">
