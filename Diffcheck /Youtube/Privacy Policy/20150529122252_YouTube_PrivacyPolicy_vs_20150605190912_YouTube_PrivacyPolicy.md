<span style="background-color: green;">you use our </span>services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.


Our Privacy Policy explains:


What information we collect and why we collect it.


How we use that information.


The choices we offer, including how to access and update information<span style="background-color: red;">.


We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about


these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know


our practices – and if you have any questions consult this page.


**Information we collect**


We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex


things like which 


**ads you’ll find most useful**, 


**the people who matter most to you online**, or which YouTube videos you might like.


We collect information in two ways:


**Information you give us.** For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal


information, like your name, email address, telephone number or 


**credit card**. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer,


we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo</span>.

How we use information we collect


We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to


protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and


ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we


may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users


already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your pu</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">l</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">tes and apps.

**Google and our users**. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may


replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have


your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as </span>your name and photo.


If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications


connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and<span style="background-color: red;"> other</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">other </span>commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to <span style="background-color: red;">


**</span>limit sharing or visibility settings<span style="background-color: red;">**</span> in your Google Account.


When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email<span style="background-color: red;"> address to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">address to </span>inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.


We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to <span style="background-color: red;">


**</span>improve your user experience<span style="background-color: red;">**</span> and the overall quality of<span style="background-color: red;"> our</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">our </span>services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>preferences, we’ll be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a<span style="background-color: green;">n

</span><span style="background-color: green;"> similar technologies </span>with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.


Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized<span style="background-color: red;"> search</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">search </span>results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.


We may <span style="background-color: red;">


**</span>combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services<span style="background-color: red;">**</span> –<span style="background-color: red;">


for</span> <span style="background-color: green;">for


</span>example <span style="background-color: red;">

<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.


Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a<span style="background-color: red;"> server</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">server </span>located outside the country where you live.

</span>Transparency and choice<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>


People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>about how<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>it is used. For example, you can:


Visit your Google Account History for settings that allow you to control the collection of personal information from Google services,<span style="background-color: red;"> such as</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">such as </span>Search, YouTube and Location History.


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might<span style="background-color: red;"> interest</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">interest </span>you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.


Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.


Control who you share information with through your Google Account.


Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.


Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.


You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>by us.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>However, it’s important to remember that many of our services <span style="background-color: red;">


**</span>may not function properly<span style="background-color: red;">**</span> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we<span style="background-color: red;"> may not</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">may not </span>remember your language preferences.

</span>Information you share<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>


Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by<span style="background-color: red;"> search</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">search </span>engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Accessing and updating your personal information<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>


Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with <span style="background-color: red;">


**</span>access to your personal information<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>. If that information is wrong, we strive to<span style="background-color: red;"> give you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">give you </span>ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When<span style="background-color: red;"> updating your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">updating your </span>personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.


We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or


fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning


information residing on backup systems).


Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We<span style="background-color: red;"> aim to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">aim to </span>maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete<span style="background-color: red;"> information from</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">information from </span>our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>our backup systems.
