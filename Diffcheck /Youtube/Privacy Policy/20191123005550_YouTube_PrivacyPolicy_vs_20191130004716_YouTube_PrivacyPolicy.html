<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
<p>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</p>
<p>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</p>

<p>INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our</p>
<p>services</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more</p>
<p>complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might</p>
<p>like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage</p>
<p>your privacy controls.</p>
<p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser,</p>
<p>application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>
<p>Things you create or provide to us</p>
<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also</p>
<p>choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might</p>
<p>choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>
<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you</p>
<p>write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Information we collect as you use our services</p>
<p>Information we collect as you use our services</p>
<p>Your apps, browsers &amp; devices</p>
<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like</p>
<p>automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile</p>
<p>network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the</p>
<p>interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date,</p>
<p>time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from</p>
<p>the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device</p>
<p>periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information</p>
<p>includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.</p>
<p>Your activity</p>
<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.</p>
<p>The activity information we collect may include:</p>
<p>Terms you search for</p>
<p>Videos you watch</p>
<p>Views and interactions with content and ads</p>
<p>Voice and audio information when you use audio features</p>
<p>Purchase activity</p>
<p>People with whom you communicate or share content</p>
<p>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</p>
<p>Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account</p>
<p>If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your</p>
<p>phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of</p>
<p>calls, routing information, and types of calls.</p>
<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.</p>
<p>Go to Google Account</p>
<p>Your location information</p>
<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your</p>
<p>weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>
<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>
<p>GPS</p>
<p>IP address</p>
<p>Sensor data from your device</p>
<p>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices</p>
<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android</p>
<p>device’s location on or off</p>
<p>using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History</p>
<p>if you want to create a private</p>
<p>map of where you go with your signed-in devices.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name</p>
<p>appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your</p>
<p>name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information</p>
<p>name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information</p>
<p>about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.</p>
<p>We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage</p>
<p>or application data caches, databases, and server logs.</p>
<p>WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA</p>
<p>We use data to build better services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Provide our services</p>
<p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share</p>
<p>content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
<p>Maintain &amp; improve our services</p>
<p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that</p>
<p>you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search</p>
<p>terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>
<p>Develop new services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized</p>
<p>their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
<p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</p>
<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and</p>
<p>customized search results. For example, Security Checkup</p>
<p>provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And</p>
<p>Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you</p>
<p>might like.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for</p>
<p>“mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can</p>
<p>control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
<p>control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
<p>We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For</p>
<p>example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your</p>
<p>phone number with the flower shop.</p>
<p>Go to Ad Settings</p>
<p>Measure performance</p>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits</p>
<p>to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers</p>
<p>understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit</p>
<p>sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with</p>
<p>activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
<p>Communicate with you</p>
<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we</p>
<p>detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about</p>
<p>upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help</p>
<p>solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
<p>Protect Google, our users, and the public</p>
<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to</p>
<p>fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to</p>
<p>provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And</p>
<p>we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize</p>
<p>patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns</p>
<p>in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For</p>
<p>example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.</p>
<p>Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to</p>
<p>improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google</p>
<p>Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS</p>
<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>
<p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Ad Settings: Manage</p>
<p>your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google</p>
<p>to show ads.</p>
<p>Exporting, removing &amp; deleting your information</p>
<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>
<p>Export your data</p>
<p>You can also request to remove content</p>
<p>from specific Google services based on applicable law.</p>
<p>To delete your information, you can:</p>
<p>Delete your content from specific Google services</p>
<p>Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity</p>
<p>Delete specific Google products</p>
<p>, including your information associated with those products</p>
<p>Delete your entire Google Account</p>
<p>Delete your information</p>
<p>And finally, Inactive Account Manager</p>

<p>unexpectedly unable to use your account.</p>
<p>There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:</p>
<p>Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You</p>
<p>can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on</p>
<p>cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.</p>
<p>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify</p>
<p>location settings</p>
<p>on your Android device.</p>

<p>Checkup</p>
<p>provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses</p>

<p>We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion,</p>

<p>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name</p>
<p>or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and</p>

<p>the flower shop.</p>

<p>Measure performance</p>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For</p>
<p>example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.</p>
<p>And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the</p>
<p>performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.</p>
<p>When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link</p>
<p>information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad</p>

<p>may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your</p>
<p>Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or</p>
<p>improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in</p>

<p>Protect Google, our users, and the public</p>
<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes</p>
<p>detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that</p>
<p>could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated</p>
<p>systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results,</p>
<p>personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your</p>
<p>content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use</p>
<p>algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate</p>
<p>across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the</p>
<p>purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you</p>
<p>might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account</p>
<p>settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in</p>
<p>order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may</p>
<p>show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This</p>
<p>helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
