<p>YouTube Pri</span>vacy<span style="background-color: green;">**</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Notice</span></p>
<p><strong>Updated as of December 8, 2010</strong></p>
<p>The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google services,</p>
<p>including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to YouTube.</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p><strong>Browsing YouTube</strong> You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You also can</p>
<p>contact us through the YouTube Help Center or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.</p>
<p><strong>Your YouTube Account.</strong> For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching</p>
<p>restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account,</p>
<p>including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account,</p>
<p>additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,<span style="background-color: red;"> groups</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">groups </span>and favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and size of<span style="background-color: red;"> data</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">data </span>transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTube (including UI elements,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>settings).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure the quality of our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>service to you,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>with you in order<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>to confirm delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong> Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., video comments,<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">your </span>profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy includes a unique<span style="background-color: red;"> application</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">application </span>number. This number, and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will be sent to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>YouTube when<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.</p>
<p>Uses</p>
<p>If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and</p>
<p>functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.</p>
<p>We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent.</p>
<p>We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major</p>
<p>YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends you email updates in your</p>
<p>YouTube Account settings page.</p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your<span style="background-color: red;"> visit</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">visit </span>or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our</p>
<p>marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries,</p>
<p>submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p>Information That is Publicly Available</p>
<p>When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be provided to</p>
<p>other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged into your YouTube</p>
<p>Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have watched.</p>
<p>Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>YouTube,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a message<span style="background-color: red;"> or comment</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or comment </span>on the site.</p>
<p>Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by</p>
<p>other YouTube users or the general public.</p>
<p>You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be</p>
<p>visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube Account<span style="background-color: red;"> channel</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">channel </span>page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be<span style="background-color: red;"> aggregated and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">aggregated and </span>shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos, videos you rated and<span style="background-color: red;"> videos that you</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">videos that you </span>have uploaded.</p>
<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings<span style="background-color: red;"> at</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">at </span>any time by visiting your account profile page.</p>
<p>You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your YouTube</p>
<p>Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that you,</p>
<p>as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and explore</p>
<p>YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may use other Google</p>
<p>services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information</p>
<p>associated with them.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">relevant </span>advertising. While you are logged in or logged out of your YouTube Account, we may also show you advertising based on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other AdSense partner sites.</p>

<p>information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from your YouTube Account data, or<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
