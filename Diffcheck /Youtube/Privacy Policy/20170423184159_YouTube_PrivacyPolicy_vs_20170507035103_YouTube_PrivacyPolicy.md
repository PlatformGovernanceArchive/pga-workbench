There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to


create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>– to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>easier. As<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

Information we collect


We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more


complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.

full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include


your name and photo.

Cookies and similar technologies


<span style="background-color: green;">Cookies and similar technologies


</span>We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may

How we use information we collect


We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to


protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results<span style="background-color: red;">


and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and


</span>ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition,<span style="background-color: red;">


we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we


</span>may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If<span style="background-color: red;">

</span>information, such as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your name and photo.


If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party<span style="background-color: red;">


applications</span> <span style="background-color: green;">applications


</span>connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including<span style="background-color: red;">


displaying</span> <span style="background-color: red;">in a</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">i</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">pl</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">yi</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">g</span> <span style="background-color: green;">in ads and


</span>other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Account.


When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email


address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.


We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality<span style="background-color: red;">


of</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of


</span>our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language


preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate<span style="background-color: red;">


an</span> <span style="background-color: green;">an


</span>identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>health.


Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized


search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.


We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for


example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and<span style="background-color: red;">


apps</span> <span style="background-color: green;">apps


</span>may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.


Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information<span style="background-color: red;">


on</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">on</span> <span style="background-color: green;">a


</span>server located outside the country where you live.

Transparency and choice


People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful<span style="background-color: red;">


choices</span> <span style="background-color: green;">choices


</span>about how it is used. For example, you can:


Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past


searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage<span style="background-color: red;">


whether</span> <span style="background-color: green;">whether


</span>certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your account.


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might


interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising services.


Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>Control who you share information with through your Google Account.


Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.


Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.


You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being<span style="background-color: red;">


set</span> <span style="background-color: green;">set



</span>by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>example, we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>may not remember your language preferences.

Information you share


Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by


search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.

Accessing and updating your personal information


Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to


give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>When<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.


We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system<span style="background-color: red;">


or</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or


</span>fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests<span style="background-color: red;">


concerning</span> <span style="background-color: green;">concerning


</span>information residing on backup systems).


Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you<span style="background-color: red;">


delete</span> <span style="background-color: green;">delete


</span>information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove<span style="background-color: red;">


information</span> <span style="background-color: green;">in</span>f<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">r</span>m<span style="background-color: green;">ation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">from

For external processing


<span style="background-color: green;">For external processing

instructions</span> <span style="background-color: green;">instructions


</span>and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.


For legal reasons


<span style="background-color: green;">For legal reasons

enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.


detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.


protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.


We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For


example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.


If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and<span style="background-color: red;">


give</span> <span style="background-color: green;">give


</span>affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Information security


We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of


information we hold. In particular:


We encrypt many of our services using SSL.


We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.


We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against


unauthorized access to systems.


We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in<span style="background-color: red;">


order</span> <span style="background-color: green;">order


</span>to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if<span style="background-color: red;">


they</span> <span style="background-color: green;">they


</span>fail to meet these obligations.

When this Privacy Policy applies


Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, services Google provides on


Android devices, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy

to</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to


</span>you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover<span style="background-color: red;">


the</span> <span style="background-color: green;">the


</span>information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and<span style="background-color: red;">


other</span> <span style="background-color: green;">other


</span>technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.


Back to top


Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks, including the EU-US<span style="background-color: red;">


and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and


</span>Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint<span style="background-color: red;">


to</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to


</span>follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints


regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
