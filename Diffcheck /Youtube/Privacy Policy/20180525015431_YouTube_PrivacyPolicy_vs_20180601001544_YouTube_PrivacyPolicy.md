choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to


control what we collect and how your information is used.


To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have


any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us

provide Google with information on nearby devi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">h a</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> Wi-Fi access points<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and </span>cell tower<span style="background-color: green;">s, and Bluetooth-enabled devices


The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account setting</span>s.<span style="background-color: green;"> For example, you can turn your Android</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">device’s location on or off


 using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History


 if you want to save and manage


your location information in your account.


In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name


appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your


name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information


about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.


We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.


We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage


or application data caches, databases, and server logs.



WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA


We use data to build better services


We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:


Provide our services


We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share


content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.


Maintain & improve our services



We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that


you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search


terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.


Develop new services


We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized


their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.


Provide personalized services, including content and ads


We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and


customized search results. For example, Security Checkup


 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And


Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you


might like.


Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for


“mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can


control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.


We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.


We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For


example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your


phone number with the flower shop.



Go to Ad Settings


Measure performance


We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits


to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers


understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit


sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with


activity from other sites that use our ad services.


Communicate with you


We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we


detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about


upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help


solve any issues you might be facing.


Protect Google, our users, and the public



We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to


fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.


We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to


provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And


we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize


patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns


in phrases you ask it to translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For


example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.


Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to


improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google


Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.


We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.


YO</span>U<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">R PRIVACY CONTROLS


You have cho</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">ces regarding the information we collect and how it's used


This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which

SHARING YO</span>U<span style="background-color: green;">R INFORMATION


Whe</span>n<span style="background-color: green;"> you share your </span>i<span style="background-color: green;">nformation


Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can


share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly,


your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.


When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing a song in Play,


your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared


endorsements setting


.


When Google shares your information


We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following


cases:


With your consent


We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to re</span>que<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;"> applica</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ion</span> <span style="background-color: red;">nu</span><span style="background-color: green;">a

We’ll ask for your explicit


consent to share any sensitive personal information.

we use service providers to help us with customer support.


For legal reasons


We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the


information is reasonably necessary to:


Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number

Cookies and similar technologies


We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service</span>,<span style="background-color: red;">

technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as


advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites. Our Google Analytics product helps


businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our


advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the


Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple


sites.


Information we collect when you are signed in to Google, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners,


may be associated with your Google Account. When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as


personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated


with your Google Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.

How we use information we collect


We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new


ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more


relevant search results and ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account.


In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently


across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them


your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.


If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-


party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1</span>’<span style="background-color: red;">s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our


services, inc</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">uding disp</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">aying</span> <span style="background-color: red;">in ads and other </span>co<span style="background-color: red;">mmercial co</span>nt<span style="background-color: red;">exts.

<span style="background-color: red;">Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such


as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.


We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other


Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings,


your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s


services and the ads delivered by Google.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.

Transparency and choice


People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make


meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:


Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on


YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit


these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you


use our services while signed-out of your account.


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which


categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising


services.


Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.


Control who you share information with through your Google Account.


Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.


Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.


You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a


cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your


cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.

Accessing and updating your personal information


Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is


wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for


legitimate business or legal purposes.


We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because


of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active


servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE


We build security into our services to protect your information


All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from
