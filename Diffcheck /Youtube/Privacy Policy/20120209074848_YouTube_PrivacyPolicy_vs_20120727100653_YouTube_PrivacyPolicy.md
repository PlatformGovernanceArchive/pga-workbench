There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new


content</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more


relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want


you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.


Our </span>P<span style="background-color: red;">lease see ou</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ivacy Policy explains:


What information we collect and why we collect it.


How we use that information.


The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.


We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about


these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know


our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.

W</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rvi</span><span style="background-color: green;"> coll</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ct information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">hich language you speak, to more complex


things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.


We collect information in two ways:

When you do, we’ll ask for personal


information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer,


we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.


</span>*<span style="background-color: green;">*Information we get from your use of our services.** We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like


when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:


**Device information**


We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and


mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google


Account.


**Log information**


When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server


logs. This may include:


details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.


telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of


calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.


Internet protocol address.


device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time


of your request and referral URL.


cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.


**Location information**


When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals


sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may,


for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

**Your YouTube Account.** For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or


watching restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create


an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.


A Google Account, additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.


**Usage Information.** When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,


groups and favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and


size of data transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTub</span>e (including<span style="background-color: red;"> UI


elements, settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure

We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more


cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we


offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites.


**How we use information we collect**


We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google


and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.


We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google</span> A<span style="background-color: red;">ny personal information or video </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ontent that you voluntarily dis</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">l</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">se o</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;">line (e</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> In addition, we may

When</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email


address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.


We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our


services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you


tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation


or health.


We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to


make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information


unless we have your opt-in consent.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.


Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server


located outside the country where you live.


**Transparency and choice**


People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how


it is used. For example, you can:


Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.


View and edit your ads preferences, such as which categories might interest you, using the Ads Preferences Manager. You can also opt out of


certain Google advertising services here.


Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals.


Control who you share information with.


Take information out of many of our services.


You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.


However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not


remember your language preferences.

Uses


If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features


and functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.


We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your


consent. We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as


notifying you of major YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends


you email updates in your YouTube Account settings page.


We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during


your visit or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the


effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed;


and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.


Information That is Publicly Available


When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be


provided to other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged


into your YouTube Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have


watched.


Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on


YouTube, such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a


message or comment on the site.


Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be


viewed by other YouTube users or the general public.


You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that


will be visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube


Account channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users


and may be aggregated and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos,


videos you rated and videos that you have uploaded.


Your Choices


If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy


settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.


You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your


YouTube Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users


may see that you, as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.


You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and


explore YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may


use other Google services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your


personal information associated with them.


Advertising on YouTube


YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie, as well as other third


YouTube Privacy Notice</span>


**A<span style="background-color: red;">bo</span><span style="background-color: green;">ccessing and </span>u<span style="background-color: green;">pda</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ing your personal information</span>**<span style="background-color: green;">


Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you


ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your


personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.


We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or


fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning


information residing on backup tapes).



Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to


maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from


our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.


**Information we share**


We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances


apply:


**With your consent**


We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We


require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.


**With domain administrators**


If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and


resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other


data). Your domain administrator may be able to:


view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.


change your account password.


suspend or terminate your account access.


access or retain information stored as part of your account.


receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.


restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.


Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.


**For external processing**


We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in


compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.


**For legal reasons**


We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access,


use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:


meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.


enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.


detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.


protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.


We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For


example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.


If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected


users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.


**Information security**


We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we


hold. In particular:


We encrypt many of our services using SSL.


We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.


We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized


access to systems.


We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process


it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these


obligations.</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">Our</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Privacy</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our


advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.


Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in


search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information

We use the DoubleClick cookie on YouTube to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other


Google and AdSense partner websites. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories


associated with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other


AdSense partner sites. Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser's website or based


on non-personally identifiable information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately


from your YouTube Account data, or other personally identifying information in our possession.


You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences


Manager for the DoubleClick cookie. Your ads preferences will be respected across YouTube, AdSense partner sites and


Google sites using the DoubleClick cookie to serve such ads. For more information about interest-based advertising and the


Ads Preference Manager see our FAQ. To learn about the privacy policies of third parties that advertisers may use to display


ads on YouTube, and to opt out, you can check out the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.


You also may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time. If you select the DoubleClick opt-out cookie, ads


delivered to your browser by our ad-serving technology will not be served based on the DoubleClick cookie. Find more


information here about opting out of the DoubleClick cookie.


Other third-party ad serving companies may display ads on YouTube, provided they comply with our ad serving requirements.

practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we
