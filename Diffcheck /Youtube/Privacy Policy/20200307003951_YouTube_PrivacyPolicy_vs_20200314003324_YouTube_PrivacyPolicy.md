We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to<span style="background-color: red;">

Maintain & improve our services


Maintain & improve our services



We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>outages or troubleshooting issues that you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>report to us. And we use your information to make<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are<span style="background-color: red;"> most</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">most </span>frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.


Develop new services


Develop new services


We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>understanding how people organized<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>design and launch Google Photos.


Provide personalized services, including content and ads


Provide personalized services, including content and ads


We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>recommendations, personalized content, and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>customized search results. For example, Security<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Checkup


 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Play uses<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>new apps you might like.


Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>example, if you search for “mountain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re<span style="background-color: green;"> browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</span>
<span style="background-color: green;">

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, s</span>ex<span style="background-color: green;">u</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">mp</span>l<span style="background-color: green;"> ori</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ntation</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">if y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u sea</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ch</span> <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">health.



We d</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">n’t show you pe</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">sonalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.


We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For


example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the</span> “<span style="background-color: red;">moun</span>ta<span style="background-color: red;">in</span><span style="background-color: green;">p to call”</span> b<span style="background-color: green;">utton, we’ll connect your call and may share your


phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance


We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to


our sites to do things l</span>ike<span style="background-color: green;"> optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand


the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do thi</span>s,<span style="background-color: red;">”</span> <span style="background-color: green;">i</span><span style="background-color: red;">you may see a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;"> a</span><span style="background-color: green;">clu</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">ing</span> <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">G</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">r sp</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">rts</span><span style="background-color: green;">gle</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Analytics. When you visit sites that use


Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other


sites that use our ad services.


Communicate with you


Communicate with you


We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we


detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about


upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your r</span>equ<span style="background-color: red;">ipm</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>t <span style="background-color: green;">i</span><span style="background-color: red;">whe</span>n <span style="background-color: red;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">rder to help solve


any iss</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">es you might be facing.


Protect Google, our users, and the public


Protect Google, our users, and the public



We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud,


abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.


We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to


provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we


analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in


data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases


you ask it to translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example,


if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending


on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve


Google</span>’<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">s s</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">

We’ll ask for your consent</span> b<span style="background-color: red;">y visiting your ad s</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;">ttings.

Measure performance


Measure performance


We use data for analytics and measurement to understand </span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ow our serv</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ce</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">are used. For


example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.


And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the


performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.


When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link


information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad


services.


Communicate with you


Communicate with you


We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we


may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your


Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or


improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in



improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in


order to help solve any issues you might be facing.


Protect Google, our users, and the public


Protect Google, our users, and the public


We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes


detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that


could harm Google, our users, or the public.


We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated


systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results,


personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your


content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use


algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate


across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the


purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you


might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account


settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in


order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may


show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This


helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.


We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this


</span>Privacy Policy.
