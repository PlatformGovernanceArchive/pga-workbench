<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Privacy<span style="background-color: green;"></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This Privacy Policy will be replaced with our new Privacy Policy, effective March 1, 2012. Please see our</em></strong> <strong><em>overview</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>page</em></strong> <strong><em>for additional details.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated as of December 8, 2010</strong></p>
<p>The Google Privacy Policy describes how Google and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use Google</p>
<p>services, including information provided when you use YouTube. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific</p>
<p>to YouTube.</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p><strong>Browsing YouTube</strong> You can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube Account or a Google Account. You also</p>
<p>can contact us through the YouTube Help Center or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.</p>
<p><strong>Your YouTube Account.</strong> For some activities on YouTube, like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or</p>
<p>watching restricted videos, you need a YouTube or Google Account. We ask for some personal information when you create</p>
<p>an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>A Google Account, additionally, allows you to access other Google services that require registration.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use YouTube, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels,</p>
<p>groups and favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and</p>
<p>size of data transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in YouTube (including UI</p>
<p>elements, settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your YouTube Account. In order to ensure</p>
<p>the quality of our service to you, we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or</p>
<p>other communications with you in order to confirm delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong> Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g., video</p>
<p>comments, your profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the YouTube Uploader, your copy</p>
<p>includes a unique application number. This number, and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number,</p>
<p>language) will be sent to YouTube when the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your</p>
<p>version of the Uploader.</p>
<p>Uses</p>
<p>If you submit personal information to YouTube, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features</p>
<p>and functionality of YouTube, and to process any flagging activity or other communication you send to us.</p>
<p>We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your</p>
<p>consent. We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as</p>
<p>notifying you of major YouTube changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how often YouTube sends</p>
<p>you email updates in your YouTube Account settings page.</p>
<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during</p>
<p>your visit or the next time you visit YouTube; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the</p>
<p>effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed;</p>
<p>and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<p>Information That is Publicly Available</p>
<p>When you create a YouTube Account, some information about your YouTube Account and your account activity will be</p>
<p>provided to other users of YouTube. This may include the date you opened your YouTube Account, the date you last logged</p>
<p>into your YouTube Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos you have</p>
<p>watched.</p>
<p>Your YouTube Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on</p>
<p>YouTube, such as when you upload videos or send messages through YouTube. Other users can contact you by leaving a</p>
<p>message or comment on the site.</p>
<p>Any videos that you submit to YouTube may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be</p>
<p>viewed by other YouTube users or the general public.</p>
<p>You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that</p>
<p>will be visible to other users on your YouTube Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your YouTube</p>
<p>Account channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users</p>
<p>and may be aggregated and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favorite videos,</p>
<p>videos you rated and videos that you have uploaded.</p>
<p>Your Choices</p>
<p>If you have a YouTube Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy</p>
<p>settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.</p>
<p>You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your</p>
<p>YouTube Account and the features that are included on your channel page. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users</p>
<p>may see that you, as identified by your account name, not your email address, are watching the same video.</p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through YouTube, in which case you can still view videos and</p>
<p>explore YouTube, but YouTube may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced YouTube features may</p>
<p>use other Google services like Google Checkout or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your</p>
<p>personal information associated with them.</p>
<p>Advertising on YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising and we use the DoubleClick cookie, as well as other third</p>

<p>advertising based on non-personally identifiable information you have provided to us in your YouTube Account.</p>
<p>We use the DoubleClick cookie on YouTube to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other</p>
<p>Google and AdSense partner websites. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories</p>
<p>associated with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, frequency of uploading or activity on other</p>
<p>AdSense partner sites. Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser's website or based</p>
<p>on non-personally identifiable information from other companies. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately</p>
<p>from your YouTube Account data, or other personally identifying information in our possession.</p>
<p>You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences</p>
<p>Manager for the DoubleClick cookie. Your ads preferences will be respected across YouTube, AdSense partner sites and</p>
<p>Google sites using the DoubleClick cookie to serve such ads. For more information about interest-based advertising and the</p>
<p>Ads Preference Manager see our FAQ. To learn about the privacy policies of third parties that advertisers may use to display</p>
<p>ads on YouTube, and to opt out, you can check out the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>
<p>You also may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time. If you select the DoubleClick opt-out cookie, ads</p>
<p>delivered to your browser by our ad-serving technology will not be served based on the DoubleClick cookie. Find more</p>
<p>information here about opting out of the DoubleClick cookie.</p>
<p>Other third-party ad serving companies may display ads on YouTube, provided they comply with our ad serving requirements.</p>
<p>YouTube does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. You</p>
<p>should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their</p>
<p>practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. YouTube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we</p>
<p>cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently</p>
<p>shared with YouTube is maintained and dealt with by YouTube in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
