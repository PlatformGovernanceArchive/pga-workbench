Privacy Policy</span>



We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:


Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home


Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system


Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps


You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to


create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when


you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to


browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what


we collect and how your information is used.


To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any


questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us

our services


We </span>collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more


complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.


The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your


privacy controls.


When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application,


or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.


When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.


<span style="background-color: green;">When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also


choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might


choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.


We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. </span>Thi<span style="background-color: red;">ng</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">you create or prov</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">ncl</span><span style="background-color: red;">de to </span>u<span style="background-color: green;">de</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> things like email you write</span>

Your apps, browsers & devices


Your apps, browsers & devices</span>



We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like


automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.


The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile


network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the


interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time,


and referrer URL of your request.


We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the


Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically


contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like


your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.


<span style="background-color: green;">We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a </span>You<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">Tube</span> <span style="background-color: red;">acti</span>vi<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">deo </span>y<span style="background-color: green;">ou might like.

Your location information


Your location information</span>


We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your


weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.


Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:


GPS


IP address


Sensor data from your device


Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices


The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s


location on or off


 using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History


 if you want to save and manage your


location information in your account.


In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears


in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may


also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential


customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive


information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.


We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or


application data caches, databases, and server logs.

Develop new services


We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized


their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.


Provide personalized services, including content and ads


Provide personalized services, including content and ads</span>


We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and


customized search results. For example, Security Checkup


 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google


Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.


Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain


bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what


information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.


We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.


We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For


example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your


phone number with the flower shop.

Measure performance


</span>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to


our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand


the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use


Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other


sites that use our ad services.


<span style="background-color: red;">Communicate with you


Communicate with you


</span>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we


detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about


upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve


any issues you might be facing.<span style="background-color: red;">


Protect Google, our users, and the public


Protect Google, our users, and the public</span>



We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud,


abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.


We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to


provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we


analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in


data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases


you ask it to translate.


We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example,


if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending


on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve


Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.


If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google


Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.


We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
