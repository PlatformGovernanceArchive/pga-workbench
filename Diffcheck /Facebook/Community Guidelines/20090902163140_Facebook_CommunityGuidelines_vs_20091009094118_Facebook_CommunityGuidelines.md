**Content Code of Conduct**

Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007

Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live

around them. People use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos

of themselves and their friends, and to learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to

be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of others, including third party intellectual

property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook and for posting

messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are set forth in our

Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO

ABIDE BY THE USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE.

FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE TERMS OF USE MAY RESULT, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, IN TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE DELETION OF CONTENT THAT YOU

HAVE POSTED ON FACEBOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AS DETERMINED BY FACEBOOK IN ITS

SOLE DISCRETION. Please refer to our Terms of Use for more information about the rules applicable to

your use of Facebook and the other rights and remedies of Facebook.

**Third-Party Content**

Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as

photographs and videos you upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you

may post and share original photographs and video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or

your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are original art or animation created by you or

your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party copyrighted content, such as the

latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we expect our users to

use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.

Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:

upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than original works that<span style="background-color: red;">

**Inappropriate Content**

speech simply do not belong in a community like Facebook. Therefore, you may not post or share

Content that:

makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone

is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful
