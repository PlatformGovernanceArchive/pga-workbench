**</span>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. 

Do not post: 

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any 

target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or 

Calls for high-severity violence (unless the target is an organization or 

individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy<span style="background-color: green;">, or is 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses, wherein 

criminal/predator status has been established by media reports, market 

knowledge of news event, etc.</span>) 

Including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the 

target and/or includes a visual of an armament to represent violence; or 

Statements advocating for high-severity violence (unless the target is an 

organization or individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and 

Organizations policy<span style="background-color: green;">, or is described as having carried out violent crimes or 

sexual offenses, wherein criminal/predator status has been established by 

media reports, market knowledge of news event, etc.</span>); or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence 

(unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous

violent crimes or sexual offenses, wherein criminal/predator status has been 

established by media reports, market knowledge of news event, etc.</span>)

**6. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not 

remove live videos of self<span style="background-color: green;"> injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and 

authorities to provide help or resources. 

 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self</span>-injury <span style="background-color: green;">or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically.

**II. Safety** 

 

<span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale 

 

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention 

to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation 

and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but 

remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, 

or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or 

coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-

consensual sexual acts. 

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual 

violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. 

As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and 

improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may 

remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful 

activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate 

images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together 

a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, 

from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending 

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for 

example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and 

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

Facebook to help protect against it. 

We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and 

educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers 

step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations 

about bullying.

Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to 

prevent that contact 

Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation

**12. Hate Speech**</span> 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. 

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity.

hate speech. 

Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span> 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as 

Any violent speech or support in written or visual form 

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to:<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span> 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”)<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span> 

Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

listed characteristics, where attack is defined as 

Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, 

mental, or moral deficiency 

Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” 

“hideous,” “ugly”) 

Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” 

“stupid,” “idiot”) 

Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) 

Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited 

to) 

"I hate" 

"I don't like" 

"X are the worst" 

Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) 

"Gross" 

"Vile" 

"Disgusting" 

Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected 

characteristics 

**Tier 3** attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people 

based on the above-listed characteristics<span style="background-color: green;">, where exclusion is defined as: 

Explicit Exclusion which includes but is not limited to "expel" or "not allowed"</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">

Political Exclusion defined as denial of right to political participation. 

Economic Exclusion defined as denial of access to economic entitlements and 

limiting participation in the labour market, 

Social Exclusion defined as including but not limited to denial of opportunity to 

gain access to spaces (incl. online) and social services.

</span>**1<span style="background-color: red;">3</span><span style="background-color: green;">2</span>. Violent and Graphic Content** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it.

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community.

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here.

<span style="background-color: red;">let</span> <span style="background-color: red;">us know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. 

We may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed 

would have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it.
