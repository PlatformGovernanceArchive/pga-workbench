<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-</p>
<p>world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity</p>
<p>are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,</p>
<p>planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial</p>
<p>harm to others, including theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and</p>
<p>humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,</p>
<p>events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and</p>
<p>raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences</p>
<p>and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as</p>
<p>human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share</p>
<p>this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for</p>
<p>sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. </p>
<p>When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible</p>
<p>manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic</p>
<p>videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the</p>
<p>video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any</p>
<p>explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on</p>
<p>the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of</p>
<p>personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's</p>
<p>David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect using their real names and identities. We ask that you</p>
<p>refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent.</p>
<p>Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or</p>
<p>creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook¹s terms.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>

<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us. Please keep in</p>
<p>mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. </p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>
