<span style="background-color: red;">Community Standards 

 

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and 

bring the world closer together. Every day, people come to 

Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of 

others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that 

happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more 

than two billion people. 

 

We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, 

we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. 

These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is 

allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to 

us and removed. Sometimes we will allow content if newsworthy, 

significant or important to the public interest – even if it might 

otherwise violate our standards. Because of the diversity of our 

global community, please keep in mind that something that may be 

disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community 

Standards.

**9. Bullying** 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making 

statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to 

threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the 

members of our community to feel safe and respected. 

We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention 

of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful 

to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they 

are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we 

require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before 

removing it. 

Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow 

discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the 

news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless 

must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about 

public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. 

Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking 

support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step 

guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, 

parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who 

have students involved with bullying. 

Do not post: 

 

Content about another private individual that reflects 

 

Claims about sexual activity 

Degrading physical descriptions 

Threats of non-consensual sexual touching 

Sexualized text targeting another individual 

An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, 

menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating 

Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual 

Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or 

physically inferior or to an inanimate object 

Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including 

by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with 

imagery 

Content that specifies an individual as the target of 

Statements of intent to commit violence 

Calls for action of violence 

Statements advocating violence 

Aspirational and conditional statements of violence 

Physical bullying 

In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking 

individual(s) by, for example 

Cursing at an individual or individuals 

Making negative character claims 

Making negative ability claims 

We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: 

Cursing 

Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation 

Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior 

Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion 

Negative character claims 

Expressions of contempt or disgust 

Calls for death or serious disease or disability 

Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared 

with no caption or a neutral or praising caption 

 

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the 

content may be disturbing: 

 

Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a 

condemning caption 

 

**10. Harassment** 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We do not tolerate harassment on F</span>acebook.<span style="background-color: green;"> We want people to feel safe to engage 

and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and 

private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the 

platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts 

if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to 

harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage 

people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. 

 

Do not: 

 

Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to 

prevent that contact 

Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation 

Send messages to any individual that contain 

Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread 

Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an 

individual or group of individuals in the thread 

Bullying policy violations

acting/pretending to be a victim of a verified event, or otherwise is paid or 

employed to mislead people about their role in the event when sent directly to 

a survivor and/or immediate family member of a survivor or victim 

Send messages to a group that contain any bullying policy violations, regardless of 

whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual 

Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by 

Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual 

exploitation

<span style="background-color: green;">When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by 

adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear 

that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and 

fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile 

or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still 

alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look 

after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they 

want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when 

the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we

<span style="background-color: red;">**prohibit on Facebook.** 

 

We don’t allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in 

the following to have a presence on Facebook: 

 

• Terrorist activity, or 

• Organized violence or criminal activity, 

• Mass or serial murderers, or 

• Organized hate groups. 

 

We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are 

involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. 

Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or 

condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. 

 

We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these 

general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards 

victims of violence and discrimination. 

 

 

**Bullying and Harassment:** **How we respond to bullying and** 

**harassment.** 

 

We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak 

freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content 

that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the 

intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but 

is not limited to: 

 

 

• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, 

• Images altered to degrade private individuals, 

• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the 

victim, and 

• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend 

requests or messages. 

 

We define private individuals as people who have neither gained 

news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions 

or public profession. 

 

 

**Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures** 

**receive on Facebook.** 

 

We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured 

in the news or have a large public audience based on their 

profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to 

public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we 

do for private individuals. 

 

**Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on** 

**Facebook.** 

 

We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal 

activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, 

or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law 

enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical 

harm or direct threats to public safety. 

 

We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve 

committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate 

for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a 

humorous or satirical way. 

 

**Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence** 

**and exploitation on Facebook.** 

 

We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or 

exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and 

sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove 

photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and 

images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people 

in the images. 

 

Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual 

material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share 

intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, 

we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services 

include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed 

sexual activity. 

 

**Regulated Goods** 

 

We prohibit any attempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or 

trade prescription drugs, marijuana, firearms or ammunition. We 

don't permit the individual purchase, sale or trade of firearms or 

ammunition. Firearm shops and online retailers may promote 

commercial activity (ex: discussing a gun for sale at their store 

location) only if they comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

We do not allow you to use Facebook's payment tools to sell or 

purchase regulated goods on our platform.

People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like 

awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of 

nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global 

community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly 

because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people 

fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have 

policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily 

when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be 

more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for 

legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at 

evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. 

 

We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in 

on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female 

breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that 

are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of 

women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with 

post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, 

sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the 

display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless 

the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. 

Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of 

sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. 

 

**Hate Speech** 

 

Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that 

directly attacks people based on their: 

• Race, 

• Ethnicity, 

• National origin, 

• Religious affiliation, 

• Sexual orientation, 

• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or 

• Serious disabilities or diseases. 

 

Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against 

these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. 

 

People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and 

practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater 

understanding. Sometimes people share content containing 

someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness 

or educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, 

we expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us 

better understand why they shared that content. 

 

We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these 

topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, 

they are more responsible when they share this kind of 

commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate 

their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is particularly 

cruel or insensitive, even if that content does not violate our 

policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their 

audience when sharing this type of content. 

 

While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools 

to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools 

we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to 

speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech 

in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can 

help create a safer and more respectful environment.

<span style="background-color: red;">graphic</span> <span style="background-color: red;">images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </span>

this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness 

about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for 

sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. 

 

When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will 

share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that 

content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what 

they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. With that said, 

there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may 

be disturbing and we add a warning screen to it so that people are 

aware before they see it.

**Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.** 

 

We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is 

secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any 

attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, 

may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate 

information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not 

allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting 

them for commercial purposes without their consent. 

 

**Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away:** 

**What happens to your account when you pass away?** 

 

Facebook is a place where people can come to share their stories 

and reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. 

Once we become aware that a person has passed away, we secure 

and memorialize accounts. We do this once we receive sufficient 

proof of death. Let us know if you want a loved one to manage your 

account after you are gone and learn more about what happens 

when we memorialize an account. 

 

Immediate family members can also request that we remove and 

delete a loved one's profile.

Protecting your intellectual property 

Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to 

you. You own all of the content and information you post on 

Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your 

privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content 

on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask 

that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal 

rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. 

Reporting Abuse 

Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools 

Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment 

free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on 

Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams 

working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. 

 

Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not 

violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal 

under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. 

 

Please keep the following in mind: 

• 

We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. 

• 

We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that 

contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. 

• 

Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not 

violate our policies. 

• 

Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our 

policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it 

nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. 

• 

Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about 

specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook 

Profile. 

• 

The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never 

remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. 

• 

The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity 

of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn 

someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a 

person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. 

 

Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we 

offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding 

the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use 

these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues 

they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve 

created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with 

posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook.
