**1. Violence and Incitement** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their 

physical safety. 

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and 

other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non 

credible absent specific evidence to the contrary.

Policy Rationale 

 

To encourage safety and compliance with common legal restrictions, we prohibit 

attempts by individuals, manufacturers, and retailers to purchase, sell, or trade non-

regulated everywhere; however, because of the borderless nature of our community, 

we try to enforce our policies as consistently as possible. Firearm stores and online 

retailers may promote items available for sale off of our services as long as those 

retailers comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We allow discussions about 

sales of firearms and firearm parts in stores or by online retailers and advocating for 

changes to firearm regulation. Regulated goods that are not prohibited by our 

Community Standards may be subject to our more stringent Commerce Policies.

While we don’t allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote 

suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not 

remove live videos of self-injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and 

authorities to provide help or resources. 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically.

provide. </span>

**7. Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity** 

**II. Safety** 

<span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale 

 

We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we 

become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for 

Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We 

know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good 

intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for 

abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or 

misappropriating the images. 

We also work with external experts, including the Facebook Safety Advisory Board, 

to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, 

especially with regard to children. Learn more about the new technology we’re using 

to fight against child exploitation. 

</span>Do not post: 

 

Content that depicts participation in or advocates for the sexual exploitation of 

children, including (but not limited to) 

 

Engaging in any sexual activity involving minors 

Adults soliciting minors 

Minors soliciting minors 

Minors soliciting adults

minors 

Content that constitutes or facilitates inappropriate interactions with children, such as 

Initiating unsolicited contact with minors (for example, private messages 

between stranger adults and minors) 

Soliciting, displaying, sharing, or viewing imagery of nude, sexualized, or 

sexual activity with minors 

Arranging real-world sexual encounters or obtaining sexual material from a 

minor directly 

Displaying nudity to minors 

Content (including photos, videos, real-world art, digital content, and text) that 

depicts 

Any sexual activity involving minors 

Minors in a sexual fetish context 

Minors with sexual elements, including (but not limited to): 

Restraints 

Focus on genitals 

Presence of aroused adult 

Presence of sex toys 

Sexualized costume 

Stripping 

Staged environment (for example, on a bed) or professionally shot 

(quality/focus/angles) 

Open-mouth kissing with minor or adult 

Content (including photos, videos, real-world art, digital content, and verbal 

depictions) that shows minors in a sexualized context 

Content that depicts child nudity where nudity is defined as 

Visible genitalia (even when covered or obscured by transparent clothing) 

Visible anus and/or fully nude close-up of buttocks 

Uncovered female nipples for children older than toddler-age 

No clothes present from neck to knee for children older than toddler-age 

Digitally-created depictions of nude minors, unless the image is for health or 

educational purposes 

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>Imagery that depicts non-sexual child abuse regardless of sharing intent 

Content that praises, supports, promotes, advocates for, provides instructions for or 

encourages participation in non-sexual child abuse<span style="background-color: green;"> 

For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or 

context to enforce: 

For the following content, we include a warning label so that people are aware that 

the content may be sensitive: 

Imagery posted by a news agency that depicts child nudity in the context of 

famine, genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, unless 

accompanied by a violating caption or shared in a violating context, in which 

case the content is removed</span>

**9. Bullying and Harassment** 

 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, 

from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending 

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for 

example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and 

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

Facebook to help protect against it. 

We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and 

educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers 

step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations 

about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying 

and harassment here. 

Do not: 

Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: 

Unwanted or 

Sexually harassing or 

Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation

Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the 

event

**10. Human Exploitation** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or 

coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define 

human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the 

exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or 

other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and 

degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or 

materially benefiting others. 

Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, 

socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and 

any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the 

coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. 

While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two 

can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as 

the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international 

borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation 

of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in 

pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on 

movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. 

Do not post: 

Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any 

of the following: 

Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults 

The sale of children for illegal adoption 

Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism 

Forced Marriages 

Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) 

Domestic Servitude 

Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking 

Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) 

Recruitment of Child Soldiers 

Content geared towards the: 

Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, 

deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. 

Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, 

harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. 

Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. 

 

Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans

**12. Hate Speech** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected 

characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define 

attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of 

inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers 

of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of 

commentary using their authentic identity.

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it.

**15. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>discussion. <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or <span style="background-color: red;">coordinates </span>

<span style="background-color: green;">coordinates </span>sexual encounters <span style="background-color: green;">or commercial sexual services </span>between adults<span style="background-color: green;"> such 

as prostitution or escort services</span>. We <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">als</span>o <span style="background-color: red;">res</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">h</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">s </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o avoid facilitating transactions that 

may involve trafficking, coercion, and non-consensual</span> sexual<span style="background-color: red;">ly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">acts. We also restrict 

s</span>ex<span style="background-color: red;">plicit lang</span>ua<span style="background-color: red;">ge</span><span style="background-color: green;">lly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">explici</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">hat</span> <span style="background-color: red;">

</span><span style="background-color: green;">language that </span>may lead to solicitation because some audiences <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>within our global community may <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>be sensitive to this type of content and it may <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>impede the ability for people to <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>connect with their friends and the broader <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>community. 

Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> 

**Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution** 

**activities, such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services** 

**and paid sexual fetish or domination services.**</span> 

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not 

limited to: 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances 

Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages 

Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or 

asking for: 

Sex or sexual partners 

Sex chat or conversations 

Nude photos/videos/imagery 

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and 

meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be 

violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but 

does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span> 

Criteria 1: Offer or Ask 

Content implicitly or indirectly***** (typically through providing a method of 

contact) offers or asks for: 

Nude imagery, or 

Sex or sexual partners, or 

Sex chat conversations 

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements 

Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the 

following sexually suggestive elements: 

Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji 

strings, or 

Regional sexualized slang, or 

Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, 

digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, 

fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or 

activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or 

Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, 

objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude 

butts 

An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links 

to external pornographic websites) 

Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or 

An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising 

fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: red;"> 

 

</span> 

**16. Cruel and Insensitive** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel 

targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for 

content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets 

victims of serious physical or emotional harm. 

We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, 

many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. 

Do not post: 

Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical 

injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains 

sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing 

premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. 

Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, 

made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged 

animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): 

premature death 

serious physical injury (including mutilation) 

physical violence from a human

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

<span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale 

Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps 

create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, 

in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is 

expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and 

identity misrepresentation. That's why we require people to connect on Facebook 

using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to 

create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another 

accountable. 

In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove 

accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the 

security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of 

automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to 

persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards. 

Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to 

give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community 

Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to 

the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued 

violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe 

safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.</span> 

Do not: 

 

Misrepresent your identity by 

 

Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to 

Instagram) 

Providing a false date of birth 

Misuse our products by 

Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old 

Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) 

Creating inauthentic profiles 

Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) 

Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the 

site 

Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the 

previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site 

Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service 

Impersonate others by 

Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people 

Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or 

entity 

Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for 

whom the user is not authorized to do so<span style="background-color: red;">. 

Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: 

The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and 

Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public</span>. 

**18. Spam** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content 

that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. 

This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to 

engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from 

abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or 

distribute content en masse for commercial gain. 

 

Do not: 

 

Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events 

or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. 

Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product 

features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, 

likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined 

by our Branded Content Policy. 

 

Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, 

sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. 

Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under 

false pretenses, such as: 

 

Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a 

‘Dislike’ button!”) 

 

Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount 

code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) 

 

Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading 

use of URLs, defined as: 

 

**Cloaking**: Presenting different content to Facebook users and 

Facebook crawlers or tools. 

 

**Misleading content:** Content contains a link that promises one 

type of content but delivers something substantially different. 

Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action 

(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected 

landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes 

after the required action is complete. 

**Like / Share-Gating**: Landing pages that require users to like, 

share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access 

to off-Facebook content. 

 

**Deceptive Landing Page Functionality**: Websites that have a 

misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic 

being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) 

 

**Impersonation**: The website pretends to be a reputable brand 

or service by usin 

g a name, domain, or content featuring 

typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known 

brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face\_book.com, using a 

landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). 

 

And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed 

above. 

**19. Cybersecurity** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal 

information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or 

invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we 

want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user 

information through the abuse of our platform and products. 

Do not: 

Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through 

unauthorized means, defined as: 

Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without 

explicit permission from the account owner. 

Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or 

programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and 

programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain 

unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. 

Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or 

through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to 

capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). 

Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, 

passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the 

use of malicious software or websites. 

Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a 

third party service. 

Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser 

extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. 

Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain 

Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that 

a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or 

Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. 

 

 

**20. Inauthentic Behavior** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent 

themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of 

content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our 

Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can 

trust the people and communities they interact with. 

Do not: 

 

Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people 

 

Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others 

 

Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control 

of that Page 

 

Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the 

use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to 

mislead people or Facebook: 

about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent 

about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets 

about the purpose of an audience or community 

about the source or origin of content 

to evade enforcement under our Community Standards 

 

Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined 

as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to 

engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake 

accounts is central to the operation 

 

Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is 

Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or 

government actor. 

 

 

**21. False news** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 

machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 

Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 

fact-checkers 

Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 

informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 

Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 

challenging issue 

 

 

**22. Manipulated Media** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many 

cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the 

manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video 

content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid 

out below have been met. 

In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, 

academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false 

news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they 

encounter online.

**23. Memorialization** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy Rationale 

 

When someone passes away, friends and family can request that 

we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>word <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>"Remembering"<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it <span style="background-color: red;">

clear </span>that <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to 

preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for 

people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span>To <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain <span style="background-color: red;">content </span>

<span style="background-color: green;">content </span>when the legacy contact or family members request it. 

Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and 

process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people 

during these difficult times. 

For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears 

on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when 

requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: 

 

Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death 

Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased 

Content related to the deceased’s death 

For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from 

the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. 

<span style="background-color: green;">
