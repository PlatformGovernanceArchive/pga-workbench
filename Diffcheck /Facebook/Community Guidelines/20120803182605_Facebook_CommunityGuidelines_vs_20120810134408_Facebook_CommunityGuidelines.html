<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your</p>
<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s. Finally, you may not publish other</p>
<p>people's personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p></span>Facebook Community Standards</p>
<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
<p>Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of</p>
<p>content may be reported and removed.</p>

<p><strong>Phishing and Spam</strong></p>
<p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to</p>
<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us. Please keep in</p>
<p>mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. </p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>
