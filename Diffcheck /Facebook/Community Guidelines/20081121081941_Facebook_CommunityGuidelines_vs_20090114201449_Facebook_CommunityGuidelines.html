<p>Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People</p>
<p>use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos of themselves and their friends, and to</p>
<p>learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of</p>
<p>others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook</p>
<p>and for posting messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are set forth in our</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as photographs and videos you</p>
<p>upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you may post and share original photographs and</p>
<p>video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are</p>
<p>original art or animation created by you or your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party</p>
<p>copyrighted content, such as the latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we</p>
<p>expect our users to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>

<p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p>
<p>While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of speech simply do</p>
