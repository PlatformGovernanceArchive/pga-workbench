<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take<span style="background-color: red;"> threats of suicide very</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">threats of suicide very </span>seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied<span style="background-color: red;"> or persistently</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or persistently </span>contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>people you've never met in person can be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,<span style="background-color: red;"> institutions, events, and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">pract</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ces, it is a serious violatio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;"> of our term</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">o s</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ngle ou</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">utions,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out</p>
<p></span>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>site. Sadistic displays<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>mindful of the consequences for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to<span style="background-color: red;"> build trust and safety</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">build trust and safety </span>for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
