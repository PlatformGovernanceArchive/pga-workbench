<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
<p>We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others</p>
<p>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow</p>
<p>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take</p>
<p>threats of suicide very seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we</p>
<p>become aware of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying &amp; Harassment</strong></p>
<p>As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports</p>
<p>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied</p>
<p>or persistently contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make</p>
<p>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or</p>
<p>people you've never met in person can be a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect</p>
<p>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,</p>
<p>institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out</p>
<p>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability, or disease.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Violence</strong></p>
<p>While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around</p>
<p>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the</p>
<p>site. Sadistic displays of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual</p>
<p>assault, are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Sex &amp; Nudity</strong></p>
<p>We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is</p>
<p>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be</p>
<p>mindful of the consequences for you and your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better</p>
<p>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a</p>
<p>violation of our terms.</p>
<p><strong>Identity &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real</p>
<p>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to</p>
<p>build trust and safety for everyone. </span>C<span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">laimi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o b</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> someo</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">e else, crea</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ing multiple</p>
<p>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates</p>
<p>Facebook</span> Co<span style="background-color: red;">de</span><span style="background-color: green;">mmunity</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Standards</p>
<p>Faceb</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">ok</span> <span style="background-color: green;">is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents</p>
<p>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment</p>
<p>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.</p>
<p>When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts</p>
<p>include controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that</p>
<p>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in classrooms.</p>
<p>As a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use</p>
<p>Facebook can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a</p>
<p>global community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p>our terms. Please also refrain from publishing other people's personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing &amp; Spam</strong></p>
<p>We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to</p>
<p>compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by</p>
<p>not contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Abuse</strong></p>
<p>If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind</p>
<p>that reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you</p>
<p>without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over</p>
<p>what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.</p>

<p>be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of others, including third party intellectual</p>
<p>property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook and for posting</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as</p>
<p>photographs and videos you upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you</p>

<p>your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are original art or animation created by you or</p>

<p>any third party</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p>
<p>While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of</p>
