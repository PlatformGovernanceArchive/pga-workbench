**1. Violence and Incitement** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their 

physical safety. 

In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and 

other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non 

credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. 

Do not post: 

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any 

target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or 

Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified 

but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to 

represent violence; or 

Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence 

Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, 

mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or 

assassin against a target. 

Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or 

conditional statements to kidnap a target. 

Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, 

minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as 

any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or 

Statements advocating violence; or 

Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified 

but a symbol represents the target; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or 

Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public 

figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or 

Calls for action of violence; or 

Statements advocating for violence; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence 

Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards 

private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is

figures that includes: 

Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or 

conditional statements to commit low-severity violence

a designated and recognizable at-risk group 

Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously 

injure or kill people, through:

Providing instructions on how to make or use explosives: 

Unless there is clear context that the content is for a non-violent purpose (for 

example part of commercial video games, clear scientific/educational 

purpose, fireworks, or specifically for fishing)

mid-severity violence due to voting, voter registration, or the outcome of an election<span style="background-color: green;">

In an effort to prevent and disrupt harmful or fraudulent activity, we remove content 

aimed at deliberately deceiving people to gain an unfair advantage or deprive 

another of money, property, or legal right. However, we allow people to raise

**<span style="background-color: red;">7</span><span style="background-color: green;">6</span>. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not 

remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and 

authorities to provide help or resources. 

 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. 

Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we 

provide.  

Do not post: 

 

Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for 

Suicide 

Self-injury 

Eating disorders 

Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery 

Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post 

content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide 

Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave 

stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated 

with eating disorders. 

 

Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared 

together with terms associated with eating disorders. 

 

For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and 

include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: 

 

Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to 

be newsworthy 

Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted 

suicide in a medical setting 

 

For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware 

the content may be upsetting to some: 

 

Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other 

non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery 

Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or 

protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. 

 

We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of 

engagement in self injury, including: 

 

Suicide 

Euthanasia/assisted suicide 

Self-harm 

Eating disorders 

Eating disorders

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention 

to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation 

and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but 

remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, 

or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or 

coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-

consensual sexual acts. 

To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual 

violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. 

As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and 

improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may 

remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful 

activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate 

images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together 

a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  

Do not post: 

In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, 

crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: 

Depictions (including real photos/videos), or 

Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or 

Statements of intent, or 

Calls for action, or 

Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or 

Admitting participation, or 

Mocking victims of any of the above 

Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: 

Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people by 

threats of exposure of their intimate imagery or intimate information 

Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery 

known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that fulfills all 

three of the following conditions: 

Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting 

Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a 

sexual pose 

Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by 

Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) 

Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) 

including entertainment media (for example, leak of images 

confirmed by media) 

A visible match between the person depicted in the image and 

the person who has reported the content to us 

The person who reported the content to us shares the same 

name as the person depicted in the image 

 

Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly 

sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person 

engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" 

or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes 

the person depicted in the imagery. 

 

Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that 

meets the following criteria: 

Lack of consent is indicated by: 

Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or 

A visible match between the person depicted in the image and 

the person who has reported the content to us 

The person who reported the content to us shares the same 

name as the person depicted in the image 

Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, 

such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual 

fetish or domination services. 

For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the 

content may be disturbing: 

Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual 

touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning 

the act if: 

Shared by the victim, or 

Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or 

condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by 

context/caption 

Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching 

**<span style="background-color: green;">9</span><span style="background-color: red;">10</span>. Bullying and Harassment**  

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, 

from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending 

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for 

example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and 

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

Facebook to help protect against it. 

We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and 

educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers 

step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations 

about bullying.

**10. Human Exploitation** 

**II. Safety** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or 

coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define 

human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the 

exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or 

other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and 

degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or 

materially benefiting others. 

Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, 

socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and 

any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the 

coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. 

While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two 

can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as 

the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international 

borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation 

of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in 

pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on 

movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. 

Do not post: 

Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any 

of the following: 

Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults 

The sale of children for illegal adoption 

Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism 

Forced Marriages 

Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) 

Domestic Servitude 

Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking 

Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) 

Recruitment of Child Soldiers 

Content geared towards the: 

Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, 

deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. 

Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, 

harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. 

Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it.

**13</span>. Hate Speech** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. 

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity. 

Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to 

hate speech. 

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** 

Content targeting a person or group of people (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses) on the basis of 

their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: 

Violent speech or support in written or visual form 

Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, 

or unqualified behavioral statements to or about: 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”) 

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons, generalizations, or behavioral

</span>**1<span style="background-color: red;">4</span><span style="background-color: green;">3</span>. Violent and Graphic Content** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it. 

Do not post: 

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

 

</span>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or 

captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain 

<span style="background-color: green;">

Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies 

Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-

a family member.

eighteen and older:

even when the contact is not directly visible, except in cases of a 

sexual health context, advertisements, and recognized fictional 

images or with indicators of fiction 

Implied stimulation of genitalia/anus, defined as stimulating 

genitalia/anus or inserting objects into genitalia/anus, even when

<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span>**1<span style="background-color: red;">6</span><span style="background-color: green;">5</span>. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community. 

Do not post: 

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not 

limited to: 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances 

Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages 

Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or 

asking for: 

Sex or sexual partners 

Sex chat or conversations 

Nude photos, videos or imagery 

Content that meets both of the following criteria: 

Criteria 1: Offer or Ask 

Content implicitly or indirectly***** (typically through providing a method of 

contact) offers or asks for: 

Nude imagery, or 

Sex or sexual partners, or 

Sex chat conversations 

Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements 

Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the 

following sexually suggestive elements: 

Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji 

strings, or 

Regional sexualized slang, or 

Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, 

digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, 

fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or 

activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or 

Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, 

objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude 

butts 

Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or 

asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. 

For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not 

ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. 

An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links 

to external pornographic websites) 

Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or 

An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising 

fetish scenarios) 

 

 

**1<span style="background-color: red;">7</span><span style="background-color: green;">6</span>. Cruel and Insensitive** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or 

premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual 

touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury 

We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, 

many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. We also remove any form of 

sadism towards people or animals. 

Do not post: 

<span style="background-color: red;">

<span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale 

 

We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content 

that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. 

This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to 

engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from 

abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or 

distribute content en masse for commercial gain.

This c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ntent c</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">eates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to 

engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from 

abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or 

distribute content *en masse* for commercial gain. 

Do not: 

 

Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events 

or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. 

Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product 

features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, 

likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined 

by our Branded Content Policy. 

Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, 

sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. 

Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under 

false pretenses, such as: 

Offering false or non-existent services or functionality(e.g., “*Get a* 

*‘Dislike’ button!*”) 

Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “*Click here for a discount* 

*code at Nordstrom*”; *false play buttons*) 

Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading 

use of URLs, defined as: 

**Cloaking:** Presenting different content to Facebook users and 

Facebook crawlers or tools. 

**Misleading content**: Content contains a link that promises one 

type of content but delivers something substantially different. 

**Deceptive Pop-up websites**: Websites that require an action 

(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected 

landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes 

after the required action is complete. 

**Like / Share-Gating:** Landing pages that require users to like, 

share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access 

to off-Facebook content. 

**Deceptive Landing Page Functionality:** Websites that have a 

misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic 

being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) 

**Impersonation:** The website pretends to be a reputable brand 

or service by using a name, domain, or content featuring typos, 

misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known brands

<span style="background-color: red;">may</span> <span style="background-color: red;">delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would 

have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard
