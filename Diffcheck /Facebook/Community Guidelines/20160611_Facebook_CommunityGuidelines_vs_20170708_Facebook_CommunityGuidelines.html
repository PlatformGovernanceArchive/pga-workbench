<p>Community Standards<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Our mission is to give people the power to build community and </p>
<p>bring the world closer together. Every day, people come to </p>
<p>Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of </p>
<p>others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that </p>
<p>happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more </p>
<p>than two billion people. </p>
<p>We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, </p>
<p>we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. </p>
<p>These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is </p>
<p>allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to </p>
<p>us and removed. Sometimes we will allow content if newsworthy, </p>
<p>significant or important to the public interest – even if it might </p>
<p>otherwise violate our standards. Because of the diversity of our </p>
<p>global community, please keep in mind that something that may be </p>
<p>disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community </p>
<p>Standards. </p>

<p>Read a letter from our team </p>
<p>Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies </p>
<p>and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make </p>
<p>Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the </p>
<p>world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a </p>
<p>community of more than a billion people around the world. </p>
<p>When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, </p>
<p>communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve </p>
<p>extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and </p>
<p>collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of </p>
<p>things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes </p>
<p>people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of </p>
<p>the community. </p>
<p>That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what </p>
<p>kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community </p>
<p>Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a </p>
<p>place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe </p>
<p>environment for everyone. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we </p>
<p>approach by focusing on a few key principles: </p>
<p>• <strong>Keeping you safe.</strong> We have zero tolerance for any behavior </p>
<p>that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or </p>
<p>advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. </p>
<p>Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook </p>
<p>helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names </p>
<p>and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. </p>
<p>• <strong>Encouraging respectful behavior.</strong> We ask people to consider </p>
<p>their audience when sharing something that may offend </p>
<p>others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see </p>
<p>the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit </p>
<p>sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. </p>
<p>• <strong>Acknowledging cultural diversity.</strong> To ensure our policies </p>
<p>reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and </p>
<p>review input from experts around the world, as well as our </p>
<p>community. Those insights help us understand the context </p>
<p>through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>• <strong>Empowering you with tools to control what you see on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> Facebook is a place for you to connect with the </p>
<p>people and things you care about, so we give you tools to </p>
<p>control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to </p>
<p>people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of </p>
<p>rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to </p>
<p>treat each other with empathy and respect. </p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<p>We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. Learn more about how </p>
<p>Facebook handles abusive content. </p>
<p><strong>Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by</strong> </p>
<p><strong>others on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify </p>
<p>serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove </p>
<p>credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove </p>
<p>specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. </p>
<p>We may consider things like a person's p<span style="background-color: red;">hysical location or p</span>ublic <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>visibility <span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">in dete</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mining</span> <span style="background-color: red;">whe</span>the<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>credible. <span style="background-color: red;">We may </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and </p>
<p>unstable regions.</span> </p>
<p><strong>Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>suicide.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work </p>
<p>with organizations around the world to provide assistance for </p>
<p>people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or </p>
<p>encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body </p>
<p>modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that </p>
<p>identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets </p>
<p>them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, </p>
<p>however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does </p>
<p>not promote these things. </p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we</strong> </p>
<p><strong>prohibit on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following </p>
<p>to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized criminal activity. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>

<p>People use Facebook to share their</span> exp<span style="background-color: red;">eriences and to raise </p>

<p>To help bala</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ce</span> <span style="background-color: red;">the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Nudity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their </p>
<p>cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and </p>
<p>respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in </p>
<p>place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when </p>
<p>reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more </p>
<p>blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate </p>
<p>purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this </p>
<p>content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing </p>
<p>in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of </p>
<p>female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow </p>
<p>photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing </p>
<p>breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs </p>
<p>of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. </p>
<p>Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also </p>
<p>apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for </p>
<p>educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of </p>
<p>sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go </p>

<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly </p>
<p>attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As </p>
<p>with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this </p>
<p>content to us. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or </p>
<p>educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we </p>
<p>expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, </p>
<p>even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we </p>
<p>urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this </p>
<p>type of content. </p>
<p>While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools </p>
<p>to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools </p>
<p>we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to </p>
<p>speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech </p>
<p>in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can </p>
<p>help create a safer and more respectful environment. </p>
<p><strong>Violence and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook has long been a place where people share their </p>
<p>experiences and raise awareness about important issues. </p>
<p>Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and </p>
<p>graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights </p>
<p>abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share </p>
<p>this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness </p>
<p>about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for </p>
<p>sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. </p>
<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>
<p>share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that </p>
<p>content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what </p>
<p>they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. </p>

<p><strong>Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real</strong> <strong>name</strong> </p>

<p>People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When </p>
<p>people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic </p>
<p>name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we </p>
<p>discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you </p>
<p>to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that </p>
<p>impersonate other people. </p>
<p>If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, </p>
<p>organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, </p>
<p>please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help </p>
<p>you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you </p>
<p>care about. </p>
<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or </p>

<p>ammunition. </span>F<span style="background-color: green;">irearm shops and online retailers may promote </p>

<p>To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse </p>
<p>community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive </p>
<p>content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we </p>
<p>do that here. </p>
<p><strong>Adult Nudity &amp; Sexual Activity</strong> </p>
<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly </p>
<p>because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people </p>
<p>fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have </p>
<p>policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily </p>
<p>when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be </p>
<p>more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for </p>
<p>legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at </p>
<p>evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in </p>
<p>on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female </p>
<p>breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that </p>
<p>are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of </p>
<p>women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with </p>
<p>post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, </p>
<p>sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the </p>
<p>display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless </p>
<p>the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of </p>
<p>sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that </p>

<p>Protecting your intellectual property </p>
<p>Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to </p>

<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>

<p>that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal </p>
<p>rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p>
