<span style="background-color: green;">**Violence and Threats**

Safety is Facebook's top priority. We remove content and may escalate to law

enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat

to public safety. You may not credibly threaten others, or organize acts of real-

world violence. Organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity

are not allowed to maintain a presence on our site. We also prohibit promoting,

planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial

harm to others, including theft and vandalism.

**Self-Harm**

Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or

encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also

work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for

people in distress.

**Bullying and Harassment**

Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely

on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive

behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with

unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.

**Hate Speech**

Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and

humorous speech. While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions,

events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others

based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual

orientation, disability or medical condition.

**Graphic Content**

Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences and

raise awareness about issues important to them. Sometimes, those experiences

and issues involve graphic content that is of public interest or concern, such as

human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share

this type of content, it is to condemn it. However, graphic images shared for

sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site. 

When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible

manner. That includes choosing carefully the audience for the content. For graphic

videos, people should warn their audience about the nature of the content in the

video so that their audience can make an informed choice about whether to watch

it.

**Nudity and Pornography**

Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any

explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on

the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of

personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's

David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.

Facebook Community Standards
