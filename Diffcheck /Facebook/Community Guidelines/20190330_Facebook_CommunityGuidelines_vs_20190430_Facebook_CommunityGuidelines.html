<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence (unless the target is an organization or </p>

<p>target and/or includes a visual of an armament to represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence (unless the target is an </p>
<p>organization or individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and </p>
<p>Organizations policy); or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>(unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous </p>
<p>Individuals and Organizations policy) </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, vulnerable persons, or vulnerable groups where threat is </p>
<p>defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence (unless the target is an adult public figure </p>
<p>convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous </p>
<p>organization); or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence (unless the target is a member of a dangerous </p>

<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>

<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>

<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that</span>'s <span style="background-color: red;">character to posting inappropriate i</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ag</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s to </p>
<p>thre</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">te</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;">ing</span> <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;"> d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">on</span><span style="background-color: green;">grad</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity</span>. We <span style="background-color: red;">do not tole</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">at</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">cognize that</span> bullying <span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">a</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p></span>Facebook <span style="background-color: green;">to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hu</span>b<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;">ecause</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">e want t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">ich</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">n cer</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ain</span> <span style="background-color: red;">instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual wh</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> is the target o</span>f<span style="background-color: red;"> bullying to report content to us be</span>f<span style="background-color: red;">or</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>r<span style="background-color: red;">emoving it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policie</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </span>step-by-step <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong>III.<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong></span>Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>

<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>

<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it.</span> </p>
<p>Do not post:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>

<p>a family member. </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation which we define as offering or requesting things, including </p>
<p>but not limited to the following: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p>Implicit sexual solicitation, which we define as an offer or request to engage paired </p>
<p>with at least one of the following elements, none of which violate our Community </p>
<p>Standards on their own: </p>
<p>Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” </p>
<p>Sexualized slang </p>
<p>Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish </p>
<p>scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act </p>
<p>of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), </p>
<p>commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or </p>
<p>buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks </p>
<p>An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Partners who share fetish or sexual interests </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or </p>
<p>mentioning of: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>17. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>

<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>

<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>

<p>Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for </p>
<p>example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination </p>
<p>URL) </p>
<p>Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks </p>
<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>

<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p></span>adding "Remembering" above the name on the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>person's profile. This makes it clear <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that the account is now a memorial site and <span style="background-color: red;">protects against attempted logins and </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">protects against attempted logins and </span>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>or change anything about the profile <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>or the account because we want to respect the <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>choices someone made while still <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>alive. We have also made it possible for people to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>identify a legacy contact to look <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>after their account after they pass away. People can <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>let us know in advance if they <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>want their account permanently deleted when they die. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We may delete profiles when <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>would have preferred that we <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>delete the account rather than memorialize it. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
