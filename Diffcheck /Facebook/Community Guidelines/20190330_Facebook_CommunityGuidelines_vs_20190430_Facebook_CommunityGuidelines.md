<span style="background-color: green;"> **1. Violence and Incitement I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

Policy Rationale 

We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. 

While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by 

threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that 

incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and 

work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm 

or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in 

order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat 

to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also 

consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. 

Do not post: 

Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any 

target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or 

Calls for high-severity violence (unless the target is an organization or 

individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy) 

Including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents the 

target and/or includes a visual of an armament to represent violence; or 

Statements advocating for high-severity violence (unless the target is an 

organization or individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and 

Organizations policy); or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence 

(unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous 

Individuals and Organizations policy) 

Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, 

minor public figures, vulnerable persons, or vulnerable groups where threat is 

defined as any of the following: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or 

Statements advocating violence (unless the target is an adult public figure 

convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous 

organization); or 

Calls for mid-severity violence (unless the target is a member of a dangerous 

organization) including content where no target is specified but a symbol 

represents the target; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence (unless the target is 

an adult public figure convicted or accused of certain crimes or is a member of 

a dangerous organization); or 

Other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public figures, vulnerable 

persons, or vulnerable groups and any credible: 

Statements of intent to commit violence; or

Statements advocating for violence; or 

Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence (unless the 

target is convicted of certain crimes or is a member of a dangerous 

organization) 

Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards 

private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is

figures that includes: 

Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or

**6. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

</span>Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk <span style="background-color: green;">to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies 

and enforcement.

threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate 

this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on 

Facebook. 

We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to 

allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are 

featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we 

remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is 

directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes 

further: we remove content that</span>'s <span style="background-color: red;">character to posting inappropriate i</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ag</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s to

harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our 

policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is 

clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying 

and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us 

understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting 

such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on 

</span>Facebook <span style="background-color: green;">to help protect against it.

We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention 

of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful 

to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they 

are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">n cer</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ain</span> <span style="background-color: red;">instances, we

**12. Hate Speech**</span> 

**III.<span style="background-color: red;">**</span> <span style="background-color: red;">

**</span>Objectionable Content** 

<span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale 

We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of 

intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual 

orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We 

also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. 

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity.

hate speech. 

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as 

Any violent speech or support in written or visual form 

 

Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: 

 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”) 

 

Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

listed characteristics, where attack is defined as 

Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, 

mental, or moral deficiency 

Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” 

“hideous,” “ugly”) 

Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” 

“stupid,” “idiot”) 

Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”)

We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity.

hate speech. 

 

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as 

Any violent speech or support in written or visual form 

 

Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: 

 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”) 

 

Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

listed characteristics, where attack is defined as 

Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, 

mental, or moral deficiency 

Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” 

“hideous,” “ugly”) 

Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” 

“stupid,” “idiot”) 

Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) 

Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited 

to) 

"I hate" 

"I don't like" 

"X are the worst" 

Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) 

"Gross"

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it.</span>

**15. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community. 

Do not post: 

Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities including but not 

limited to: 

 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances 

Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages 

 

Explicit sexual solicitation which we define as offering or requesting things, including 

but not limited to the following: 

 

Sex or sexual partners 

Sex chat or conversations 

Nude images 

 

Implicit sexual solicitation, which we define as an offer or request to engage paired 

with at least one of the following elements, none of which violate our Community 

Standards on their own: 

 

Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” 

Sexualized slang 

Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish 

scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act 

of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), 

commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or 

buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks 

 

An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: 

 

Commercial pornography 

Partners who share fetish or sexual interests 

 

Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or 

mentioning of: 

 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) 

An act of sexual intercourse<span style="background-color: green;"> 

</span> 

 

**16. Cruel and Insensitive** 

**III<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Objectionable Content**

**IV.<span style="background-color: red;">** 

**Integrity and Authenticity** 

**17. Spam** 

**IV:</span> Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Policy Rationale 

We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, 

fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and 

connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to 

collect likes, followers, or shares.

Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend 

before viewing 

 

Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses 

 

Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: 

Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable 

information 

Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable 

information 

 

Promise non-existent Facebook features 

**18. Misrepresentation** 

**IV<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Do not: 

 

Misrepresent your identity by 

 

Using a name that does not abide by our name policies 

Providing a false date of birth

entity 

Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for 

whom the user is not authorized to do so. 

Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: 

 

The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and 

Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. 

Engage in inauthentic behavior, which includes creating, managing, or otherwise 

perpetuating 

Accounts that are fake 

Accounts that have fake names 

Accounts that participate, , or claim to engage in in coordinated inauthentic 

behavior, meaning that multiple accounts are working together to do any of 

the following: 

 

Mislead people about the origin of content 

Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for 

example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination 

URL) 

Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks

**19. False news** 

<span style="background-color: green;">**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

</span>Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a

,</span>When <span style="background-color: green;">someone passes a</span>w<span style="background-color: red;">e le</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">rn</span><span style="background-color: green;">y,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">fri</span><span style="background-color: red;">that som</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">o</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">e has passe</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">s</span> a<span style="background-color: green;">nd family can request 

that </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">ay, w</span>e memorialize the account by <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>adding "Remembering" above the name on the <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>person's profile. This makes it clear <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>that the account is now a memorial site and <span style="background-color: red;">protects against attempted logins and </span>

<span style="background-color: green;">protects against attempted logins and </span>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>or change anything about the profile <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>or the account because we want to respect the <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>choices someone made while still <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>alive. We have also made it possible for people to <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>identify a legacy contact to look <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>after their account after they pass away. People can <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>let us know in advance if they <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>want their account permanently deleted when they die. <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>We may delete profiles when <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed <span style="background-color: green;">

</span>would have preferred that we <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>delete the account rather than memorialize it. <span style="background-color: green;">
