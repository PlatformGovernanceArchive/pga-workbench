<p>Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007</p>
<p>Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live</p>
<p>around them. People use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos</p>
<p>of themselves and their friends, and to learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to</p>
<p>be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of others, including third party intellectual</p>
<p>property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook and for posting</p>
<p>messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are set forth in our</p>
<p>Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO</p>
<p>ABIDE BY THE USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE.</p>
<p>FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE TERMS OF USE MAY RESULT, AMONG</p>
<p>OTHER THINGS, IN TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE DELETION OF CONTENT THAT YOU</p>
<p>HAVE POSTED ON FACEBOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AS DETERMINED BY FACEBOOK IN ITS</p>
<p>SOLE DISCRETION. Please refer to our Terms of Use for more information about the rules applicable to</p>
<p>your use of Facebook and the other rights and remedies of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as</p>
<p>photographs and videos you upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you</p>
<p>may post and share original photographs and video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or</p>
<p>your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are original art or animation created by you or</p>
<p>your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party copyrighted content, such as the</p>
<p>latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we expect our users to</p>
<p>use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>
<p>upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than original works that are created</p>
<p>by you or another user</p>

<p>any third party</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p>
<p>While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of</p>
<p>speech simply do not belong in a community like Facebook. Therefore, you may not post or share</p>
<p>Content that:</p>
<p>is obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit</p>
<p>depicts graphic or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone</p>
<p>is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful</p>

<p>Facebook to be a safe place on the internet. Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>

<p>any person or entity</p>
