<p><strong>Violence and Threats</strong></p>
<p>Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or</p>
<p>organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law</p>
<p>enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat</p>
<p>to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your</p>
<p>actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and</p>
<p>vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Harm</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously. We remove any promotion or</p>
<p>encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse. We also</p>
<p>work with suicide prevention agencies around the world to provide assistance for</p>
<p>people in distress.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely</p>
<p>on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive</p>
<p>behavior directed at private individuals. Repeatedly targeting other users with</p>
<p>unwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge</p>
<p>ideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person</p>
<p>based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, disability or medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Content</strong></p>
<p>People use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand</p>
<p>that graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance</p>
<p>the needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic</p>
<p>pleasure is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nudity and Pornography</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and</p>
<p>imposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect</p>
<p>people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos</p>
<p>of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture</p>
<p>creates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be</p>
<p>another person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization</p>
<p>undermines community and violates Facebook’s terms. Finally, you may not publish</p>
<p>other people's personal information.</p>

<p>Facebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many</p>
<p>other people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook – and the opinions</p>
<p>expressed here – mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. </p>
<p>To balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community</p>
<p>standards outlined on this page. </p>
