<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>A<span style="background-color: green;">ttacks through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. whore, slut) </p>
<p>A</span>n individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>

<p><strong>10. Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Targeted cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>

<p>a survivor and/or immediate family member of a survivor or victim </p>
<p>Send messages to a group that contain any bullying policy violations, regardless of </p>
<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>
<p>exploitation </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual </p>
<p>orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also </p>
<p>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or </p>
<p>segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>
<p>Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited </p>
<p>to) </p>
<p>"I hate" </p>
<p>"I don't like" </p>
<p>"X are the worst" </p>
<p>Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) </p>
<p>"Gross" </p>
<p>"Vile" </p>
<p>"Disgusting" </p>
<p>Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected </p>
<p>characteristics </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people </p>
<p>based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration </p>
<p>policies and arguments for restricting those policies. </p>
<p><strong>Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs</strong>, where slurs are </p>
<p>defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed </p>
<p>characteristics. </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>
<p>Charred or burning people <span style="background-color: green;">unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </span></p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Videos that show child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>

<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities including but </p>
<p>not limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that engages in explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the </p>
<p>following, offering or asking for: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that engages in implicit sexual solicitation, which can be identified by </p>
<p>mentioning a sexual act and other suggestive elements such as any of the following:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” </p>
<p>Sexualized slang </p>
<p>Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish </p>
<p>scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act </p>
<p>of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), </p>
<p>commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or </p>
<p>buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks </p>
<p>Content (hand drawn, digital, or real-world art) that may depict explicit sexual </p>
<p>activity or suggestively posed person(s) </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that offers or asks for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Partners who share fetish or sexual interests </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>

<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>

<p><strong>19. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>20. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>

<p></span><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
