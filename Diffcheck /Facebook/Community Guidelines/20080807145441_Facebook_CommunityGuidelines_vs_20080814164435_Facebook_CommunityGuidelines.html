<p><strong>Content Code of Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Date of Last Revision: May 24, 2007</p>
<p>Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People</p>
<p>use Facebook to keep up with friends, to share links, to share photos and videos of themselves and their friends, and to</p>
<p>learn more about the people they meet. We want Facebook to be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of</p>
<p>others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we have established certain rules for using Facebook</p>
<p>and for posting messages, photos, video and other content ("Content") on Facebook, which rules are set forth in our</p>
<p>Terms of Use and in this User Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE FACEBOOK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THE</p>
<p>USER CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS</p>
<p>CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE TERMS OF USE MAY RESULT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IN TERMINATION OF YOUR</p>
<p>ACCOUNT AND THE DELETION OF CONTENT THAT YOU HAVE POSTED ON FACEBOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AS</p>
<p>DETERMINED BY FACEBOOK IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. Please refer to our Terms of Use for more information about the</p>
<p>rules applicable to your use of Facebook and the other rights and remedies of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends, such as photographs and videos you</p>
<p>upload from your camera, webcam or mobile phone. This means that you may post and share original photographs and</p>
<p>video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are</p>
<p>original art or animation created by you or your friends. It is not intended as a place for you to post third-party</p>
<p>copyrighted content, such as the latest episode of a popular TV show or your favorite music video. In addition, we</p>
<p>expect our users to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>
<p>upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than original works that are created by you</p>
<p>or another user</p>
<p>post or share any Content that infringes upon or violates the copyright, trademarks or other rights of any</p>
<p>third party</p>
<p>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p>
<p>While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of speech simply do</p>
<p>not belong in a community like Facebook. Therefore, you may not post or share Content that:</p>
<p>is obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit</p>
<p>depicts graphic or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone</p>
<p>is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful</p>
<p><strong>Unlawful or Harmful Content or Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Although as an online service provider, we are not responsible for the conduct of our users, we want Facebook to be a</p>
<p>safe place on the internet. Therefore, in using Facebook, you may not:</p>
<p>violate any local, state, national or international law or post any Content that would encourage or provide</p>
<p>instructions for a criminal offense</p>
<p>impersonate any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent yourself, your age or your affiliation with any</p>
<p>person or entity</p>
<p>use Facebook to send or make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional</p>
<p>materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation</p>
<p>post or share any personally identifiable or private information of any third party</p>

<p>the Facebook Code of Conduct or Terms of Use</p>

<p>interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications</p>
<p>equipment</p>

<p>authorization or create a false identity on the Service or the Site</p>
