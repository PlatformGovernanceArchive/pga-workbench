<p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>

<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk </p>
<p>groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or<span style="background-color: red;">-</span> </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>

<p>alleged to be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share </p>
<p>familial and/or romantic relationships with a member of an at-risk group or have </p>
<p>performed professional activities in support of an at-risk group (except for political </p>
<p>figures). </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>
<p>Photos or videos that show or simulate the end result (serious injury or death) </p>
<p>as part of the instruction </p>

<p>defense, for military training purposes, commercial video games, or news </p>
<p>coverage (posted by Page or with news logo) </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps. We regularly </p>
<p>consult with experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies and </p>
<p>enforcement, and work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to </p>
<p>people in distress. </p>
<p>While we don’t allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote </p>
<p>suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want </p>
<p>Facebook to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness </p>
<p>about these issues, and seek support from one another. </p>
<p>We define self-injury as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We remove any content that encourages suicide or </p>
<p>self-injury, including fictional content such as memes or illustrations and any self-</p>
<p>injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also remove content that </p>
<p>identifies and negatively targets victims or survivors of suicide or self-injury seriously, </p>
<p>humorously or rhetorically, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. </p>
<p>Content about recovery of suicide or self-harm that is allowed, but may contain </p>
<p>imagery that could be upsetting, such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity </p>
<p>screen. </p>
<p>When people post or search for suicide or self-injury- related content, we will direct </p>
<p>them to local organizations that can provide support and if someone is at immediate </p>
<p>risk of harming themselves, we will contact local emergency services to get them </p>
<p>help. </p>
<p>With respect to live content, experts have told us that if someone is saying they </p>
<p>intend to attempt suicide on a livestream, we should leave the content up for as long </p>
<p>as possible, because the longer someone is talking to a camera, the more </p>
<p>opportunity there is for a friend or family member to call emergency services. </p>
<p>However, to minimize the risk of others being negatively impacted by viewing this </p>
<p>content, we will stop the livestream at the point at which the threat turns into an </p>
<p>attempt. As mentioned above, in any case, we will contact emergency services if we </p>
<p>identify someone is at immediate risk of harming themselves. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Content that mocks victims or survivors of suicide, self-injury or eating disorders who </p>
<p>are either publicly known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury </p>
<p></span>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>
<p>Self-harm </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We may remove suicide notes when we have confirmation of a suicide or <span style="background-color: red;">suicide </span></p>

<p></span>including but not <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>limited to, family or legal representative requests, media <span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p><strong>7. Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we </p>
<p>become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for </p>
<p>Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We </p>
<p>know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good </p>
<p>intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for </p>
<p>abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or </p>
<p>misappropriating the images. </p>
<p>We also work with external experts, including the Facebook Safety Advisory Board, </p>
<p>to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, </p>
<p>especially with regard to children. Learn more about the new technology we’re using </p>
<p>to fight against child exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts participation in or advocates for the sexual exploitation of </p>
<p>children, including (but not limited to) </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>In an effort to create space for this </p>
<p>conversation and promote<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>a safe environment, we allow victims to share their </p>
<p>experiences, but<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>violence, <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sexual assault, or sexual exploitation<span style="background-color: red;">, </span>. We also<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>remove content that <span style="background-color: red;">displays, </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">displays, </span>advocates for, or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>avoid <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>facilitating non-consensual sexual acts </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we also remove images that depict incidents of </p>
<p>sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>person(s)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>experts to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>issues, and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>we may remove content when they provide information that content is <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>linked to <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>harmful activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>against <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>intimate images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put </p>
<p>together a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your </p>
<p>consent. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Sextortion: Coercing money, favors, or intimate imagery from people with </p>
<p>threats to expose their intimate imagery or intimate information </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for imagery </p>
<p>known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that fulfills all </p>
<p>three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>

<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations that </p>

<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on </p>
<p>certain fictional videos (e.g., digital and hand-drawn imagery, film and TV show </p>
<p>scenes, comic books, music videos) that depict non-consensual sexual touching.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>In addition to our at-scale policy of removing content that threatens or advocates </p>
<p>rape or other non-consensual sexual touching, we may also disable the posting </p>
<p>account. </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously by: </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>

<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>

<p>to change people’s sexual orientation or gender identity </p>
<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Imagery of People</strong> </p>
<p>Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>

<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Live streams of capital punishment of a person </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>
<p>eighteen and older: </p>
<p><strong>Imagery of People</strong> </p>

<p>Videos depicting humans killing animals if there is no explicit manufacturing, </p>
<p>hunting, or food consumption, processing or preparation context </p>

<p>dismemberment of non-regenerating body, unless in the wild </p>
<p>Imagery of humans committing acts of torture or abuse against live animals </p>
<p>Imagery of animals showing wounds or cuts that render visible innards or </p>
<p>dismemberment, if there is no explicit manufacturing, hunting, taxidermy, </p>
<p>medical treatment, rescue or food consumption, preparation or processing </p>
<p>context or the animal is already skinned or with its outer layer fully removed. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a label so that people are aware the content </p>
<p>may be sensitive: </p>
<p>Imagery of non-medical foreign objects voluntarily inserted into people through skin </p>
<p>in religious or cultural context </p>
<p>Imagery of visible innards in a birthing context </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>We remove: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Videos and photos that show the violent death of someone when a family </p>
<p>member requests its removal<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>14. Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to </p>
<p>removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage </p>
<p>content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created </p>
<p>content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that </p>
<p>nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise </p>
<p>awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons. Where such intent </p>
<p>is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some </p>
<p>images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including </p>
<p>those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding, and </p>
<p>photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the </p>
<p>anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we </p>
<p>include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive. </p>
<p>We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude </p>
<p>figures. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Images of </p>
<p>Real nude adults, where nudity is defined as </p>
<p>Visible genitalia except in the context of birth giving and after-birth </p>
<p>moments or health-related situations (for example, gender confirmation </p>
<p>surgery, examination for cancer or disease prevention/assessment) </p>
<p>Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless </p>
<p>photoshopped on a public figure </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this </p>
<p>discussion. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual encounters or commercial sexual services between adults such </p>
<p>as prostitution or escort services. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that </p>
<p>may involve trafficking, coercion, and non-consensual sexual acts. We also restrict </p>
<p>sexually explicit language that may lead to solicitation because some audiences </p>
<p>within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content and it may </p>
<p>impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader </p>
<p>community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>activities, such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and paid sexual fetish or domination services.</strong> </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>

<p></span><strong>17. Account Integrity and Authentic Identity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps </p>
<p>create a community where people are <span style="background-color: green;">.</span><span style="background-color: red;">accoun</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o e</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ch other, and to Face</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">le t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> each </span>o<span style="background-color: green;">k</span><span style="background-color: red;">ther</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">i</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>meaningful ways. We wan</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;"> allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is </p>
<p>expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and </p>
<p>identity misrepresentation. That's why we require people to connect on</span> Facebook<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">in meaningf</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">sing the name they go by in everyday </span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ife. Our authenticity policies are intended to </p>
<p>create a safe environment</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">here people c</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">n tru</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">t and hold one another </p>
<p>accountable</span>. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove </p>
<p>accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the </p>
<p>security of other accounts and our services. </span>We <span style="background-color: green;">have built a combination of </p>
<p>automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to </p>
<p>persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Because account level removal is a severe action, </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">he</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">ever</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">p</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> a</span><span style="background-color: green;">ssib</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">lo</span><span style="background-color: green;">e, </span>w<span style="background-color: red;"> for th</span>e <span style="background-color: red;">r</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">im</span><span style="background-color: red;">nge</span> <span style="background-color: green;">t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">f</span> <span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued </p>
<p>violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe </p>
<p>safety risks will lead to an account being disabled. </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience<span style="background-color: green;">,</span><span style="background-color: red;"> and</span> detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities<span style="background-color: green;">, and can threaten the security, stability, </p>
<p>and usability of our services</span>. We also aim to prevent people from <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>abusing our <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>

<p></span>information by deceptive or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>safe atmosphere that we <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">user </span>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>

<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>

<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>

<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>

<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Videos that have been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity </p>
<p>or quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe: </p>
<p>A subject of the video said words that they did not say, AND </p>
<p>The video is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, </p>
<p>including deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that </p>
<p>merges, combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a </p>
<p>video, creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said.<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the word </p>
<p>"Remembering" appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it that </p>
<p>the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. </p>
<p>To support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain </p>
<p>content when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>When brought to our attention by the legacy contact or a family member of the </p>
<p>deceased, we will: </p>
<p>Remove violating comments on a memorialized profile, which would typically </p>
<p>require the individual to self report so that we know that they are unwanted </p>
<p>Remove praise or support for the death, disease, or harm of the deceased </p>
<p>person on a memorialized profile </p>
<p>Change the deceased’s individual’s privacy settings from public to friends-only </p>
<p>when there is harmful content on the profile </p>
<p>Change a violating account name on the profile of the deceased individual </p>

<p></span><strong>24. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>25. User requests</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>
<p>User requests for removal of their own account </p>
<p>Requests for removal of a deceased user's account from a verified immediate </p>
<p>family member or executor </p>
<p>Requests for removal of an incapacitated user's account from an authorised </p>
<p>representative </p>
<p><strong>26. Additional Protection of Minors</strong> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Content-Related Requests and Decisions</strong> </p>
<p>We comply with: </p>

<p>example, beating by an adult or strangling or suffocating by an adult </p>
<p>Legal guardian requests for removal of attacks on unintentionally famous </p>
<p>minors </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>We may remove content created for the purpose of identifying a private minor if there </p>
<p>may be a risk to the minor’s safety when requested </p>
