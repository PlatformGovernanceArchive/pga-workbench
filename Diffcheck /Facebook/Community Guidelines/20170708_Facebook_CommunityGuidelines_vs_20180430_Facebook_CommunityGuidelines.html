<p><span style="background-color: red;">Community Standards </p>
<p>Our mission is to give people the power to build community and </p>
<p>bring the world closer together. Every day, people come to </p>
<p>Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of </p>
<p>others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that </p>
<p>happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more </p>
<p>than two billion people. </p>
<p>We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, </p>
<p>we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. </p>
<p>These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is </p>
<p>allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to </p>
<p>us and removed. Sometimes we will allow content if newsworthy, </p>
<p>significant or important to the public interest – even if it might </p>
<p>otherwise violate our standards. Because of the diversity of our </p>
<p>global community, please keep in mind that something that may be </p>
<p>disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community </p>
<p>Standards. </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on F</span>acebook.<span style="background-color: green;"> We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Bullying policy violations </p>

<p>acting/pretending to be a victim of a verified event, or otherwise is paid or </p>
<p>employed to mislead people about their role in the event when sent directly to </p>
<p>a survivor and/or immediate family member of a survivor or victim </p>
<p>Send messages to a group that contain any bullying policy violations, regardless of </p>
<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>
<p>exploitation </p>
<p>Threatening any participant in public discourse with violence in an attempt to </p>
<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Target victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by image, with claims that </p>
<p>they are </p>
<p>Lying about being a victim of an event </p>
<p>Acting/pretending to be a victim of an event </p>
<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the event </p>

<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable </p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>

<p>We don’t allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in </p>
<p>the following to have a presence on Facebook: </p>
<p>• Terrorist activity, or </p>
<p>• Organized violence or criminal activity, </p>
<p>• Mass or serial murderers, or </p>
<p>• Organized hate groups. </p>
<p>We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are </p>
<p>involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. </p>
<p>Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or </p>
<p>condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. </p>
<p>We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these </p>
<p>general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards </p>
<p>victims of violence and discrimination. </p>
<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment:</strong> <strong>How we respond to bullying and</strong> </p>
<p><strong>harassment.</strong> </p>
<p>We don’t tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow you to speak </p>
<p>freely on matters and people of public interest, but remove content </p>
<p>that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the </p>
<p>intention of degrading or shaming them. This content includes, but </p>
<p>is not limited to: </p>
<p>• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, </p>
<p>• Images altered to degrade private individuals, </p>
<p>• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the </p>
<p>victim, and </p>
<p>• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend </p>
<p>requests or messages. </p>
<p>We define private individuals as people who have neither gained </p>
<p>news attention nor the interest of the public, by way of their actions </p>
<p>or public profession. </p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Public Figures: What protection public figures</strong> </p>
<p><strong>receive on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured </p>
<p>in the news or have a large public audience based on their </p>
<p>profession or chosen activities. We remove credible threats to </p>
<p>public figures, as well as hate speech directed at them – just as we </p>
<p>do for private individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Criminal Activity: How we handle reports of criminal activity on</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal </p>
<p>activity that causes physical harm to people, businesses or animals, </p>
<p>or financial damage to people or businesses. We work with law </p>
<p>enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical </p>
<p>harm or direct threats to public safety. </p>
<p>We also prohibit you from celebrating any crimes you’ve </p>
<p>committed. We do, however, allow people to debate or advocate </p>
<p>for the legality of criminal activities, as well as address them in a </p>
<p>humorous or satirical way. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual Violence and Exploitation: How we fight sexual violence</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and exploitation on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or </p>
<p>exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and </p>
<p>sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove </p>
<p>photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and </p>
<p>images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people </p>
<p>in the images. </p>
<p>Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual </p>
<p>material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share </p>
<p>intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, </p>
<p>we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services </p>
<p>include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed </p>
<p>sexual activity. </p>
<p><strong>Regulated Goods</strong> </p>
<p>We prohibit any attempts by private individuals to purchase, sell, or </p>
<p>trade prescription drugs, marijuana, firearms or ammunition. We </p>
<p>don't permit the individual purchase, sale or trade of firearms or </p>
<p>ammunition. Firearm shops and online retailers may promote </p>
<p>commercial activity (ex: discussing a gun for sale at their store </p>
<p>location) only if they comply with all applicable laws and regulations. </p>
<p>We do not allow you to use Facebook's payment tools to sell or </p>
<p>purchase regulated goods on our platform. </p>

<p>People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like </p>
<p>awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of </p>
<p>nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global </p>
<p>community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly </p>
<p>because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people </p>
<p>fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have </p>
<p>policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily </p>
<p>when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be </p>
<p>more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for </p>
<p>legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at </p>
<p>evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. </p>
<p>We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in </p>
<p>on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female </p>
<p>breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that </p>
<p>are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of </p>
<p>women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with </p>
<p>post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, </p>
<p>sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the </p>
<p>display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless </p>
<p>the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>
<p>Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of </p>
<p>sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that </p>
<p>directly attacks people based on their: </p>
<p>• Race, </p>
<p>• Ethnicity, </p>
<p>• National origin, </p>
<p>• Religious affiliation, </p>
<p>• Sexual orientation, </p>
<p>• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or </p>
<p>• Serious disabilities or diseases. </p>
<p>Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against </p>
<p>these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. </p>
<p>People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and </p>
<p>practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater </p>
<p>understanding. Sometimes people share content containing </p>
<p>someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness </p>
<p>or educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, </p>
<p>we expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us </p>
<p>better understand why they shared that content. </p>
<p>We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these </p>
<p>topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, </p>
<p>they are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate </p>
<p>their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is particularly </p>
<p>cruel or insensitive, even if that content does not violate our </p>

<p>When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will </p>

<p>there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may </p>
<p>be disturbing and we add a warning screen to it so that people are </p>
<p>aware before they see it. </p>

<p><strong>Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.</strong> </p>
<p>We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is </p>
<p>secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any </p>
<p>attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, </p>
<p>may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate </p>
<p>information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not </p>
<p>allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting </p>
<p>them for commercial purposes without their consent. </p>
<p><strong>Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>What happens to your account when you pass away?</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook is a place where people can come to share their stories </p>
<p>and reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. </p>
<p>Once we become aware that a person has passed away, we secure </p>
<p>and memorialize accounts. We do this once we receive sufficient </p>
<p>proof of death. Let us know if you want a loved one to manage your </p>
<p>account after you are gone and learn more about what happens </p>
<p>when we memorialize an account. </p>
<p>Immediate family members can also request that we remove and </p>
<p>delete a loved one's profile. </p>

<p>Protecting your intellectual property </p>
<p>Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to </p>
<p>you. You own all of the content and information you post on </p>
<p>Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your </p>
<p>privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content </p>
<p>on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask </p>
<p>that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal </p>
<p>rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse </p>
<p>Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools </p>
<p>Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment </p>
<p>free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on </p>
<p>Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams </p>
<p>working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. </p>
<p>Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not </p>
<p>violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal </p>
<p>under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. </p>
<p>Please keep the following in mind: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that </p>
<p>contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not </p>
<p>violate our policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our </p>
<p>policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it </p>
<p>nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about </p>
<p>specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook </p>
<p>Profile. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never </p>
<p>remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity </p>
<p>of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn </p>
<p>someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a </p>
<p>person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. </p>
<p>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we </p>
<p>offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding </p>
<p>the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use </p>
<p>these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues </p>
<p>they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve </p>
<p>created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with </p>
<p>posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook. </p>
