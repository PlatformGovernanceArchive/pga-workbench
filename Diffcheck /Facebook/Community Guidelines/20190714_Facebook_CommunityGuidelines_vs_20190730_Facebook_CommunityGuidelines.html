<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Policy Rationale<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and vulnerability. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence <span style="background-color: green;">including content where no target is specified </p>

<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>

<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults<span style="background-color: green;"> (2</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>nd</strong></span> <span style="background-color: green;"><strong>version July 2019)</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Participation by yourself or others to engage in any form of the above </p>
<p>mentioned sexual acts. </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing imagery that fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, media coverage or law </p>
<p>enforcement record) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Secretly taken imagery of <span style="background-color: red;"> </span>a real person's commonly sexualized body <span style="background-color: red;"> </span>(such <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>as <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the breasts, groin, or buttocks) or of a real person engaged in sexual <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>activity. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" or "upskirts" <span style="background-color: green;">and includes </p>
<p>photos or videos</span>:<span style="background-color: red;">and</span> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">includes photos or videos:</span> </p>

<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment<span style="background-color: green;"> (2</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>nd</strong></span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>version July 2019)</strong> </span> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner than is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p></span><strong>11. Hate Speech<span style="background-color: green;"> (2</strong><strong>nd</strong> <strong>version July 2019)</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. </p>
<p>We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>12. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster or comments under such imagery that contain </p>
<p>Enjoyment of suffering </p>
<p>Enjoyment of humiliation </p>
<p>Erotic response to suffering </p>
<p>Remarks that speak positively of the violence; or </p>
<p>Remarks indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing </p>
<p>pleasure </p>
<p>Videos of dying, wounded, or dead people if they contain </p>
<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs; partially decomposed bodies </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>
<p>Throat-slitting </p>
<p>Videos or photos that depict non-sexual child abuse, defined as </p>
<p>Repeated kicking, beating, slapping, or stepping on by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Strangling or suffocating by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Drowning by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Biting through skin by an adult or animal </p>
<p>Poisoning by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible restraint by an adult </p>
<p>Inflicting of burn or cut wounds by an adult </p>
<p>Forcible smoking </p>
<p>Tossing, rotating, or shaking of an infant (too young to stand) by their </p>
<p>wrists/ankles, arms/legs, or neck </p>
<p>Videos and photos showing violent death of persons can be removed if requested by </p>
<p>a family member. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing. We also limit the ability to view the content to adults, ages </p>

<p><strong>14. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude images </p>
<p>Content that meets both of the following criteria: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly (typically through providing a method of contact) </p>
<p>offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the following </p>
<p>sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Content that mentions or depicts hints of sexual activity such as: sexual </p>
<p>roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual </p>
<p>intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Including content (hand drawn, digital, or real world art) that depicts </p>
<p>sexual activity (explicit or implicit), or </p>
<p>Including imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human </p>
<p>parts, objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. </p>
<p>An offer or ask for other adult activities such as: </p>
<p>Commercial pornography </p>
<p>Nude images, unless modeling context is clear </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse </p>
<p><strong>15. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>16. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, </p>
<p>fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people's ability to share and </p>
<p>connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to </p>
<p>collect likes, followers, or shares. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Artificially increase distribution for financial gain </p>
<p>Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to </p>
<p>Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or </p>
<p>private individual </p>
<p>Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people </p>
<p>Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend </p>
<p>before viewing </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses </p>
<p>Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by: </p>
<p>Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable </p>
<p>information </p>
<p>Promise non-existent Facebook features </p>
<p><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook account after being banned from the site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p>Engage in inauthentic behavior, which includes creating, managing, or otherwise </p>
<p>perpetuating </p>
<p>Accounts that are fake </p>
<p>Accounts that have fake names </p>
<p>Accounts that participate in, or claim to engage in, coordinated inauthentic </p>
<p>behavior, meaning that multiple accounts are working together to do any of </p>
<p>the following: </p>
<p>Mislead people about the origin of content </p>
<p>Mislead people about the destination of links off our services (for </p>
<p>example, providing a display URL that does not match the destination </p>
<p>URL) </p>
<p>Mislead people in an attempt to encourage shares, likes, or clicks </p>
<p>Mislead people to conceal or enable the violation of other policies </p>
<p>under the Community Standards </p>
<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale</p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that we memorialize </p>
<p>the account by adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This </p>
<p>makes it clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against </p>
<p>attempted logins and fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change </p>
<p>anything about the profile or the account because we want to respect the choices </p>
<p>someone made while still alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify </p>
<p>a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away. People can let us </p>
<p>know in advance if they want their account permanently deleted when they die. We </p>
<p>may delete profiles when the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would </p>
<p>have preferred that we delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard </p>
<p>Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and process.</p>

<p></span><strong>20. Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V. Respecting Intellectual Property</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously and believes that they are </p>
<p>important to promoting expression, creativity and innovation in our community. You </p>
<p>own all of the content and information that you post on Facebook, and you control </p>
<p>how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before </p>
<p>sharing content on Facebook, please make sure that you have the right to do so. We </p>
<p>ask that you respect other people's copyrights, trademarks and other legal rights. We </p>
<p>are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their </p>
<p>intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post </p>
<p>content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright </p>
<p>and trademark. We publish information about the intellectual property reports that we </p>
<p>receive in our bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed </p>
<p>at https://transparency.facebook.com/ </p>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from a rights holder or an authorised representative, we will </p>
<p>remove or restrict content that engages in: </p>
<p>Copyright infringement </p>
<p>Trademark infringement </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
