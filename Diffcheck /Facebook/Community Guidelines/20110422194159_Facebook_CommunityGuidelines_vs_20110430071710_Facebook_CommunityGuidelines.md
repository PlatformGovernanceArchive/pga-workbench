**Threats**

We want our members to feel safe on the site. Any credible threats to harm others<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>will be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.

**Promoting Self-Harm**

Facebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>the promotion of suicide, "cutting," eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take<span style="background-color: red;">

threats</span> <span style="background-color: green;">th</span><span style="background-color: red;">of suicide ve</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">eats</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of suicide very

</span>seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>become aware of them.

**Bullying & Harassment**

As a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>of harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied<span style="background-color: red;">

or</span> <span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">pe</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">sistently</span> <span style="background-color: green;">persistently

</span>contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>meaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>people you've never met in person can be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>a form of harassment.

**Hate Speech**

Facebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>when you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,<span style="background-color: red;">

institutions,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">events, and pract</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ces, it is a serious violatio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;"> of our term</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">o s</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ngle ou</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">utions, events, and</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out </span>individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>orientation, disability, or disease.

**Graphic Violence**

While we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>the world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>site. Sadistic displays<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>assault, are prohibited.

**Sex & Nudity**

We have a strict "no nudity or pornography" policy. Any content that is<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>inappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>mindful of the consequences for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you and your environment.

**Theft, Vandalism, or Fraud**

We are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>place. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>violation of our terms.

**Identity & Privacy**

Facebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>identities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to<span style="background-color: red;">

build</span> <span style="background-color: green;">b</span><span style="background-color: red;">tr</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">il</span><span style="background-color: red;">st an</span>d <span style="background-color: red;">safe</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">rust</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and safety

</span>for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>accounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates<span style="background-color: green;"> our terms. Please also refrain from</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">publishing other people's personal information.

**Intellectual Property**

Before sharing content on </span>Facebook<span style="background-color: green;">, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.

**Phishing & Spam**

We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by not contacting them for

commercial purposes without their consent.

Facebook</span> Community Standards

Facebook is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>unique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>where everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.

When millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>include controversial topics and content. We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>happens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>classrooms.

As a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Facebook can and do report content that they<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>global community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:

**Reporting Abuse**

If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind

that reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.

Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you

without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over

what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.

</span>Content that does violate our terms may be removed from our site and (in some cases) subject to legal or other<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>action.
