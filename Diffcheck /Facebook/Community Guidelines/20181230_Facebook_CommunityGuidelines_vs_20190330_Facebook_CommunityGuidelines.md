**6. Suicide and Self-Injury** 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that 

encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time 

depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-

injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can 

share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from 

one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. 

We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in 

distress. We also talk withto experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our 

policies and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we 

should not remove live videos of self-harm while there is an opportunity for loved 

ones and authorities to provide help or resources. 

In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or 

survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically.

provide. </span>

</span>**9. Bullying** 

**II<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making 

statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to 

threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the 

members of our community to feel safe and respected. 

We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention 

of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful 

to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they 

are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we 

require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before 

removing it. 

Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow 

discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the 

news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless 

must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about 

public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. 

Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking 

support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step 

guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, 

parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who 

have students involved with bullying.

physically inferior or to an inanimate object 

Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including 

by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with 

imagery 

Content that specifies an individual as the target of 

Statements of intent to commit violence 

Calls for action of violence 

Statements advocating violence 

Aspirational and conditional statements of violence 

Physical bullying 

Claims about religious identity or blasphemy 

In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking 

individual(s) by, for example 

Cursing at an individual or individuals 

Making negative character claims 

Making negative ability claims 

Claims about blasphemy 

Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual 

than the person referenced and targets more than one individual

Cursing 

Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation 

Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior 

Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion 

Negative character claims 

Expressions of contempt or disgust 

Calls for death or serious disease or disability 

Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared 

with no caption or a neutral or praising caption 

 

 

In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a 

different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to 

target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We 

remove: 

 

 

Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: 

 

Claims about sexual activity 

Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or 

physically inferior or to an inanimate object 

Degrading physical descriptions

Policy Rationale 

 

We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage 

and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and 

private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the 

platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts 

if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to 

harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage 

people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it.

prevent that contact 

Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation

We define </span>hat<span style="background-color: green;">e speech as a direct attack on people based on</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">hat w</span>e call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, <span style="background-color: red;">caste </span>sexual

<span style="background-color: green;">also </span>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, <span style="background-color: green;">or</span><span style="background-color: red;">and</span> calls for exclusion or <span style="background-color: red;">

</span>segregation. <span style="background-color: red;">A</span><span style="background-color: green;">

We separate a</span>ttacks <span style="background-color: red;">are separated </span>into three tiers of severity,<span style="background-color: green;"> as</span> described below.<span style="background-color: green;"> 

Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the 

purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms 

that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an 

empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic 

break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in 

a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In 

all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their 

intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is 

unclear, we may remove the content. 

We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we 

believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary 

using their authentic identity.

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

</span> 

**13. Violent and Graphic Content** 

**III<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or 

violent nature before they click to see it. 

Do not post:

captions by the poster that contain 

<span style="background-color: red;">

a family member.</span>

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community.

**19. False news** 

<span style="background-color: red;">**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

</span>Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 

machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 

Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 

fact-checkers 

Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 

informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 

Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 

challenging issue<span style="background-color: red;"> 

</span> 

**20. Memorialization** 

**IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity** 

When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by 

adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear 

that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and 

fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile 

or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still 

alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look 

after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they 

want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when 

the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we 

delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more 

information about our memorialization policy and process.<span style="background-color: green;">
