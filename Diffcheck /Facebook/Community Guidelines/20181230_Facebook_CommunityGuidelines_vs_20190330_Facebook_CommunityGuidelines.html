<p><strong>6. Suicide and Self-Injury</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk withto experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our </p>
<p>policies and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we </p>
<p>should not remove live videos of self-harm while there is an opportunity for loved </p>
<p>ones and authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically.   </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide. </span> </p>

<p></span><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>High-severity physical descriptions </p>
<p>Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>

<p>We define </span>hat<span style="background-color: green;">e speech as a direct attack on people based on</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">hat w</span>e call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, <span style="background-color: red;">caste </span>sexual </p>
<p>orientation<span style="background-color: green;">, caste</span>, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious dis<span style="background-color: red;">ability or dis</span>ease<span style="background-color: green;"> or disability</span>. We <span style="background-color: red;">also </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">also </span>provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or </p>
<p>dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, <span style="background-color: green;">or</span><span style="background-color: red;">and</span> calls for exclusion or <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>We separate a</span>ttacks <span style="background-color: red;">are separated </span>into three tiers of severity,<span style="background-color: green;"> as</span> described below.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those </p>
<p>described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is </p>
<p>defined as </p>
<p>Any violent speech or support in written or visual form </p>
<p>Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: </p>
<p>Insects </p>
<p>Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically </p>
<p>inferior </p>
<p>Filth, bacteria, disease and feces </p>
<p>Sexual predator </p>
<p>Subhumanity </p>
<p>Violent and sexual criminals </p>
<p>Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or </p>
<p>saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] </p>
<p>are ‘criminals’”) </p>
<p>Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person </p>
<p>is depicted in an image </p>
<p>Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-</p>
<p>listed characteristics, where attack is defined as </p>
<p>Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person's or a group's physical, </p>
<p>mental, or moral deficiency </p>
<p>Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” </p>
<p>“hideous,” “ugly”) </p>
<p>Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” </p>
<p>“stupid,” “idiot”) </p>

<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Imagery of violence committed against real people or animals with comments or </p>
<p>captions by the poster that contain </p>

<p>Dismemberment unless in a medical setting </p>
<p>Visible internal organs </p>
<p>Charred or burning people unless in the context of cremation or self-</p>
<p>immolation when that action is a form of political speech or newsworthy </p>
<p>Victims of cannibalism </p>

<p><strong>19. False news</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p></span>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>20. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">.</span><span style="background-color: green;">:</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
