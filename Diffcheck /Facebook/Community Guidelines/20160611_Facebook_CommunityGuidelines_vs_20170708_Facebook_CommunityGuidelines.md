Community Standards<span style="background-color: green;"> 

 

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and 

bring the world closer together. Every day, people come to 

Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of 

others and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that 

happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more 

than two billion people. 

 

We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, 

we've developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. 

These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is 

allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to 

us and removed. Sometimes we will allow content if newsworthy, 

significant or important to the public interest – even if it might 

otherwise violate our standards. Because of the diversity of our 

global community, please keep in mind that something that may be 

disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community 

Standards.

Read a letter from our team 

 

Hello! We lead the teams that create Facebook's content policies 

and provide support to the community. Our teams work to make 

Facebook an open and safe environment for people around the 

world. We’d like to share a few insights into what it’s like serving a 

community of more than a billion people around the world. 

 

When we share information and opinions with our friends, families, 

communities, and the world around us, that's when we achieve 

extraordinary things - new ideas, opportunities, friendships, and 

collaborations. Every day, people around the world share billions of 

things on Facebook that add value to our lives. But sometimes 

people share content that can be abusive or harmful to the rest of 

the community. 

 

That’s why we created Community Standards – to explain what 

kinds of things shouldn't be shared on Facebook. Our Community 

Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a 

place to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe 

environment for everyone. 

 

As you can imagine, striking the right balance is a tough job that we 

approach by focusing on a few key principles: 

 

 

• **Keeping you safe.** We have zero tolerance for any behavior 

that puts people in danger, whether someone is organizing or 

advocating real-world violence or bullying other people. 

Requiring people to use their authentic identity on Facebook 

helps motivate all of us to act responsibly, since our names 

and reputations are visibly linked to our words and actions. 

• **Encouraging respectful behavior.** We ask people to consider 

their audience when sharing something that may offend 

others. We make it easy for everyone to decide who can see 

the content they share, and we have policies that prohibit 

sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. 

• **Acknowledging cultural diversity.** To ensure our policies 

reflect the diversity of our community, we constantly seek and 

review input from experts around the world, as well as our 

community. Those insights help us understand the context 

through which people are sharing, and viewing, content on 

Facebook. 

• **Empowering you with tools to control what you see on** 

**Facebook.** Facebook is a place for you to connect with the 

people and things you care about, so we give you tools to 

control what you see, report things to us, and reach out to 

people who post things that you don't like or disagree with. 

Our goal is to create an environment where we don’t need a lot of 

rules, and people on Facebook feel motivated and empowered to 

treat each other with empathy and respect. 

 

Thank you,

**Regulated Goods** 

We remove content, disable accounts, and work with law 

enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical 

harm or direct threats to public safety. Learn more about how 

Facebook handles abusive content. 

 

**Direct Threats: How we help people who feel threatened by** 

**others on Facebook.** 

 

We carefully review reports of threatening language to identify 

serious threats of harm to public and personal safety. We remove 

credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove 

specific threats of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. 

 

We may consider things like a person's p<span style="background-color: red;">hysical location or p</span>ublic <span style="background-color: red;">

<span style="background-color: red;">assume credibility of any threats to people living in violent and 

unstable regions.</span> 

 

**Self-Injury: How we work to help prevent self-injury and** 

**suicide.** 

 

We don’t allow the promotion of self-injury or suicide. We work 

with organizations around the world to provide assistance for 

people in distress. We prohibit content that promotes or 

encourages suicide or any other type of self-injury, including self-

mutilation and eating disorders. We don't consider body 

modification to be self-injury. We also remove any content that 

identifies victims or survivors of self-injury or suicide and targets 

them for attack, either seriously or humorously. People can, 

however, share information about self-injury and suicide that does 

not promote these things. 

 

**Dangerous Organizations: What types of organizations we** 

**prohibit on Facebook.** 

 

<span style="background-color: red;">We don’t allow any organizations that are engaged in the following 

to have a presence on Facebook: 

 

 

• Terrorist activity, or 

• Organized criminal activity. 

 

We also remove content that expresses support for groups that are 

involved in the violent or criminal behavior mentioned above. 

Supporting or praising leaders of those same organizations, or 

condoning their violent activities, is not allowed. 

 

We welcome broad discussion and social commentary on these 

general subjects, but ask that people show sensitivity towards 

victims of violence and discrimination.

that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the

is not limited to: 

 

 

• Pages that identify and shame private individuals, 

• Images altered to degrade private individuals, 

• Photos or videos of physical bullying posted to shame the 

victim, and 

• Repeatedly targeting other people with unwanted friend

**Viole</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ce an</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> Graphic Content** 

People use Facebook to share their</span> exp<span style="background-color: red;">eriences and to raise 

awareness about issues that are important to them. This means that 

you may encounter opinions that are different from yours, which we 

be</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ieve can lead t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">mpor</span>ta<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> conversat</span>ion<span style="background-color: red;">s</span> <span style="background-color: red;">ab</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ut difficult topics. 

To help bala</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ce</span> <span style="background-color: red;">the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse 

community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive 

content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we 

do that here. 

 

**Nudity** 

 

People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like 

awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of 

nudity because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their 

cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and 

respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in 

place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when 

reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more 

blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate 

purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this 

content and enforcing our standards. 

 

We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing 

in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of 

female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow 

photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing 

breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs 

of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. 

Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also 

apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for 

educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of 

sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go 

into vivid detail may also be removed. 

 

**Hate Speech** 

 

Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly 

attacks people based on their: 

 

 

• Race, 

• Ethnicity, 

• National origin, 

• Religious affiliation, 

• Sexual orientation, 

• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or 

• Serious disabilities or diseases. 

 

Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against 

these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As 

with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this 

content to us. 

 

People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and 

practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater 

understanding. Sometimes people share content containing 

someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness or 

educating others about that hate speech. When this is the case, we 

expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us 

better understand why they shared that content. 

 

We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these 

topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, 

they are more responsible when they share this kind of 

commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate 

their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, 

even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we 

urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this 

type of content. 

 

While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools 

to avoid distasteful or offensive content. Learn more about the tools 

we offer to control what you see. You can also use Facebook to 

speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech 

in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can 

help create a safer and more respectful environment. 

 

**Violence and Graphic Content** 

 

Facebook has long been a place where people share their 

experiences and raise awareness about important issues. 

Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and 

graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights 

abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share 

this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness 

about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for 

sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. 

 

When people share anything on Facebook, we expect that they will 

share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that 

content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what 

they are about to see if it includes graphic violence.

Keeping your account and personal 

information secure

**Overview** 

• 

**Using Your Authentic Identity** 

• 

**Fraud and Spam** 

• 

**Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away** 

We work hard to help keep your account secure and protect your 

personal information. By joining Facebook, you agree to use your 

authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal 

information of others without their consent. Learn more about how 

we work to keep your information safe. 

 

**Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s real** **name** 

**requirement creates a safer environment.** 

 

People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When 

people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic 

name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we 

discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you 

to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that 

impersonate other people. 

 

If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, 

organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, 

please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can help 

you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause you 

care about. 

 

**Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.** 

 

We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is 

secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any 

attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, 

may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate 

information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not 

allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting 

them for commercial purposes without their consent. 

 

**Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away: How** 

**you can create a place to remember lost loved ones on** 

**</span>Facebook.** 

 

<span style="background-color: green;">We remove content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or 

exploitation. This includes the sexual exploitation of minors, and 

sexual assault. To protect victims and survivors, we also remove 

photographs or videos depicting incidents of sexual violence and 

images shared in revenge or without permissions from the people 

in the images. 

 

Our definition of sexual exploitation includes solicitation of sexual 

material, any sexual content involving minors, threats to share 

intimate images, and offers of sexual services. Where appropriate, 

we refer this content to law enforcement. Offers of sexual services 

include prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed 

sexual activity. 

 

**Regulated Goods**

**Violence and Graphic Content** 

People use Facebook to share their experiences and to raise 

awareness about issues that are important to them. This means that 

you may encounter opinions that are different from yours</span>, w<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">e secure and memor</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">ch we 

be</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ieve can lead to important conversations about difficult topics. 

To help balance the needs, safety, and interests of a diverse 

community, however, we may remove certain kinds of sensitive 

content or limit the audience that sees it. Learn more about how we 

do that here. 

 

**Adult Nudity & Sexual Activity** 

 

People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like 

awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of 

nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global 

community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly 

because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people 

fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have 

policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily 

when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be 

more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for 

legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at 

evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. 

 

We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in 

on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female 

breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that 

are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of 

women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with 

post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, 

sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the 

display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless 

the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. 

Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of 

sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed. 

 

**Hate Speech** 

 

Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that 

directly attacks people based on their: 

• Race, 

• Ethnicity, 

• National origin, 

• Religious affiliation, 

• Sexual orientation, 

• Sex, gender, or gender identity, or 

• Serious disabilities or diseases. 

 

Organ</span>iz<span style="background-color: red;">e </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ccoun</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ion</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> and people dedicated to promoting hatred against 

these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">

 

People can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and 

practices. Such discussion can promote debate and greater 

understanding. Sometimes people share content containing 

someone else's hate speech for the purpose of raising awareness 

or educating others about that hate speech. </span>W<span style="background-color: red;">e do 

t</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">is onc</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> we receive sufficie</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">t</span> <span style="background-color: red;">proof of dea</span>th<span style="background-color: green;">is is the case, 

we expect people to clearly indicate their purpose, which helps us 

better understand why they shared that content</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">

 

We allow humor, satire, or social commentary related to these 

topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, 

they are more responsible when they share this kind of 

commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate 

their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is particularly 

cruel or insensitive, even if that content does not violate our 

policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their 

audience when sharing this type of content. 

 

While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools 

to avoid distasteful or offensive content. </span>Learn more about <span style="background-color: red;">

we offer to control what you see</span>. <span style="background-color: red;">

</span><span style="background-color: green;">You</span> <span style="background-color: green;">can also use Facebook to </span>

<span style="background-color: green;">speak up and educate the community around you. Counter-speech 

in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can 

help create a safer and more respectful environment. 

 

 

**Violence and Graphic Content** 

 

Facebook has long been a place where people share their 

experiences and raise awareness about important issues. 

Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and 

graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights 

abuses or acts of terrorism. </span>I<span style="background-color: red;">mmediate family members ca</span>n <span style="background-color: red;">also request that we re</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ove </span>an<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span> <span style="background-color: red;">

there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may 

be disturbing and we add a warning screen to it so that people are 

aware before they see it.

<span style="background-color: green;">We w</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">rk hard to help keep your accou</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">t secure and protect your 

personal information. By joining</span> Facebook, <span style="background-color: green;">you agree to use your 

authentic name and identity. You may not publish the personal 

information of others without their consent. Learn more about how 

we work to keep your information safe. 

 

**Using Your Authentic Identity: How Facebook’s authentic** 

**identity policy creates a safer environment.** 

 

People connect on Facebook using their authentic identities. When 

people stand behind their opinions and actions with their authentic 

name and reputation, our community is more accountable. If we 

discover that you have multiple personal profiles, we may ask you 

to close the additional profiles. We also remove any profiles that 

impersonate other people. 

 

If you want to create a presence on Facebook for your pet, 

organization, favorite movie, games character, or another purpose, 

please create a Page instead of a Facebook Profile. Pages can 

help you conduct business, reach out to fans, or promote a cause 

you care about. 

 

**Fraud and Spam: How we protect you from fraud and spam.** 

 

We work hard to help ensure that the information you share is 

secure. We investigate any suspected breach of security. Any 

attempt to compromise the security of a Profile, including fraud, 

may be referred to law enforcement. Using misleading or inaccurate 

information to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares is not 

allowed. We also ask that you respect people by not contacting 

them for commercial purposes without their consent. 

 

**Accounts of Friends or Family Who Have Passed Away:** 

**What happens to your account when you pass away?** 

 

Facebook is a place where people can come to share their stories 

and reminisce about friends and family who have passed away. 

Once we become aware that a person has passed away, we secure 

and memorialize accounts. We do this once we receive sufficient 

proof of death. Let us know if you want a loved one to manage your 

account after you are gone and learn more about what happens 

when we memorialize an account. 

 

Immediate family members can also request that we remove and 

delete a loved one's profile.

Protecting your intellectual property 

Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to 

you. You own all of the content and information you post on 

Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your 

privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content 

on Facebook, </span>please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask 

that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal 

rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. 

Reporting Abuse 

Reporting Abuse Controlling What You SeeCommunication Tools 

Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment 

free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on 

Facebook that you believe violates our terms, please report it to us. We have dedicated teams 

working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. 

 

Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not 

violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal 

under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. 

 

Please keep the following in mind: 

• 

We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. 

• 

We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that 

contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. 

• 

Reporting something doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not 

violate our policies. 

• 

Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our 

policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it 

nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. 

• 

Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about 

specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook 

Profile. 

• 

The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never 

remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. 

• 

The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity 

of the violation and the person's history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn 

someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a 

person's ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook. 

 

Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we 

offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding 

the posts, people, Pages, and applications you don’t want to see – and we encourage you to use 

these controls to better personalize your experience. Learn more. People also often resolve issues 

they have about a piece of content by simply reaching out to the person who posted it. We’ve 

created tools for you to communicate directly with other people when you’re unhappy with 

posts, photos, or other content you see on Facebook.
