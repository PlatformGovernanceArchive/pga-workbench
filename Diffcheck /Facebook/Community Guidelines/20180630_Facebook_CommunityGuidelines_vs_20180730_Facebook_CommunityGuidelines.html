<p><strong>9. Bullying</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making </p>
<p>statements degrading someone's character to posting inappropriate images to </p>
<p>threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the </p>
<p>members of our community to feel safe and respected. </p>
<p>We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention </p>
<p>of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful </p>
<p>to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they </p>
<p>are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we </p>
<p>require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before </p>
<p>removing it. </p>
<p>Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow </p>
<p>discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the </p>
<p>news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless </p>
<p>must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about </p>
<p>public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. </p>
<p>Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking </p>
<p>support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step </p>
<p>guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, </p>
<p>parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who </p>
<p>have students involved with bullying. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content about another private individual that reflects </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Threats of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p>Sexualized text targeting another individual </p>
<p>An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, </p>
<p>menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating </p>
<p>Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual </p>
<p>Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Content that has been photoshopped to target and demean an individual, including </p>
<p>by highlighting specific physical characteristics or threatening violence in text or with </p>
<p>imagery </p>
<p>Content that specifies an individual as the target of </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence </p>
<p>Calls for action of violence </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence </p>
<p>Aspirational and conditional statements of violence </p>
<p>Physical bullying </p>
<p>Claims about religious identity or blasphemy </p>
<p>In addition, we may remove Pages or Groups that are dedicated to attacking </p>
<p>individual(s) by, for example </p>
<p>Cursing at an individual or individuals </p>
<p>Making negative character claims </p>
<p>Making negative ability claims </p>
<p>Claims about blasphemy </p>
<p>Appearing to be first person but is actually posted by a different individual </p>
<p>than the person referenced and targets more than one individual </p>
<p>We also remove content that is targeted at minors when it contains: </p>
<p>Cursing </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Allegations about criminal or illegal behavior </p>
<p>Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion </p>
<p>Negative character claims </p>
<p>Negative ability claims </p>
<p>Expressions of contempt or disgust </p>
<p>Calls for death or serious disease or disability </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared </p>
<p>with no caption or a neutral or praising caption </p>
<p>In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a </p>
<p>different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to </p>
<p>target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We </p>
<p>remove: </p>
<p>Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: </p>
<p>Claims about sexual activity </p>
<p>Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or </p>
<p>physically inferior or to an inanimate object </p>
<p>Degrading physical descriptions </p>
<p>Cursing at a person </p>
<p>Claims about romantic involvement or sexual orientation </p>
<p>Negative character or ability claims </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Videos of physical bullying or violence against minors in a fight context shared with a </p>
<p>condemning caption </p>

<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage </p>
<p>and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and </p>
<p>private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the </p>
<p>platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts </p>
<p>if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to </p>
<p>harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage </p>
<p>people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact a single person despite that person's clear desire and action to </p>
<p>prevent that contact </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact large numbers of people with no prior solicitation </p>
<p>Send messages to any individual that contain </p>
<p>Cursing aimed at an individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>
<p>Calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical harm aimed at an </p>
<p>individual or group of individuals in the thread </p>

<p>whether the person being targeted is a public or private individual </p>
<p>Target anyone maliciously, including public figures, by </p>
<p>Attacking them based on their status as a victim of sexual assault or sexual </p>

<p>intimidate or silence them </p>
<p>Calling for self-injury or suicide of a specific person, or group of people </p>
<p>Target victims or survivors of violent tragedies by name or by image, with claims that </p>
<p>they are </p>

<p>Otherwise paid or employed to mislead people about their role in the event </p>

<p><strong>18. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>19. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV<span style="background-color: red;">:</span><span style="background-color: green;">.</span> Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by </p>
<p>adding "Remembering" above the name on the person's profile. This makes it clear </p>
<p>that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and </p>
<p>fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile </p>
<p>or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still </p>
<p>alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look </p>
<p>after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they </p>
<p>want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when </p>
<p>the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we </p>
<p>delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more </p>
<p>information about our memorialization policy and process. </p>
