<p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) targeting </p>
<p>people or places where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>unnamed specified persons, minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk </p>
<p>groups where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>

<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>

<p>conditional statements to commit low-severity violence </p>
<p>Imagery of private individuals or minor public figures that has been manipulated to </p>
<p>include threats of violence either in text or pictorial (adding bulls eye, dart, gun to </p>
<p>head, etc.) </p>
<p>Content that exposes the identity or locations affiliated with any individual who is </p>
<p>alleged to be a member of a designated and recognizable at-risk group, share </p>
<p>familial and/or romantic relationships with a member of an at-risk group or have </p>
<p>performed professional activities in support of an at-risk group (except for political </p>
<p>figures). </p>

<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>

<p>While we don’t allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote </p>
<p>suicide or self-injury, we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want </p>
<p></span>Facebook<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;"> to be a space</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">here people can share their experiences, raise awareness </p>

<p><strong>7. Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we </p>
<p>become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for </p>
<p>Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We </p>
<p>know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good </p>
<p>intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for </p>
<p>abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or </p>
<p>misappropriating the images. </p>
<p>We also work with external experts, including the Facebook Safety Advisory Board, </p>
<p>to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, </p>
<p>especially with regard to children. Learn more about the new technology we’re using </p>
<p>to fight against child exploitation. </p>

<p>We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on </p>

<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans </p>
<p><strong>11. Privacy Violations and Image Privacy Rights</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>

<p>from illegal sources. </p>
<p>We also provide people ways to report imagery that they believe to be in violation of </p>
<p>their privacy rights. </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, and also provide certain protections for immigration status. We define </p>
<p>attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of </p>
<p>inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers </p>
<p>of severity, as described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>In addition, we believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of </p>
<p>commentary using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content explicitly providing or offering to provide products or services that aim </p>
<p>to change people’s sexual orientation or gender identity<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p><strong>13. Violent and Graphic Content</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>
<p></span>Do not post:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>

<p>Live streams of capital punishment of a person </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>

<p>dismemberment of non-regenerating body, unless in the wild </p>
<p>Imagery of humans committing acts of torture or abuse against live animals </p>
<p>Imagery of animals showing wounds or cuts that render visible innards or </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>discussion. <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or <span style="background-color: red;">coordinates </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">coordinates </span>sexual encounters <span style="background-color: green;">or commercial sexual services </span>between adults<span style="background-color: green;"> such </p>
<p>as prostitution or escort services</span>. We <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">als</span>o <span style="background-color: red;">res</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">h</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">s </span>t<span style="background-color: green;">o avoid facilitating transactions that </p>
<p>may involve trafficking, coercion, and non-consensual</span> sexual<span style="background-color: red;">ly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">acts. We also restrict </p>
<p>s</span>ex<span style="background-color: red;">plicit lang</span>ua<span style="background-color: red;">ge</span><span style="background-color: green;">lly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">explici</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">hat</span> <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">language that </span>may lead to solicitation because some audiences <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>within our global community may <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>be sensitive to this type of content and it may <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>impede the ability for people to <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>connect with their friends and the broader <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>community. </p>
<p>Do not post:<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p><strong>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>activities, such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services</strong> </p>
<p><strong>and paid sexual fetish or domination services.</strong></span> </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos/videos/imagery </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p>meets both of the following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating:<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios)<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We believe that people share and connect more freely when they do not feel </p>
<p>targeted based on their vulnerabilities. As such, we have higher expectations for </p>
<p>content that we call cruel and insensitive, which we define as content that targets </p>
<p>victims of serious physical or emotional harm. </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their serious physical </p>
<p>injury, starvation, or serious or fatal disease or disability.Content that contains </p>
<p>sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real people experiencing </p>
<p>premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps </p>
<p>create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, </p>
<p>in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is </p>
<p>expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and </p>
<p>identity misrepresentation. That's why we require people to connect on Facebook </p>
<p>using the name they go by in everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to </p>
<p>create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another </p>
<p>accountable. </p>
<p>In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove </p>
<p>accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the </p>
<p>security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of </p>
<p>automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to </p>
<p>persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards. </p>
<p>Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to </p>
<p>give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community </p>
<p>Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to </p>
<p>the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued </p>
<p>violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe </p>
<p>safety risks will lead to an account being disabled.</span> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies (not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram) </p>
<p>Providing a false date of birth </p>
<p>Misuse our products by </p>
<p>Creating a profile for someone under thirteen years old </p>
<p>Maintaining multiple accounts (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating inauthentic profiles </p>
<p>Sharing an account with any other person (not applicable to Instagram) </p>
<p>Creating another Facebook or Instagram account after being banned from the </p>
<p>site </p>
<p>Creating or Managing a Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile because the </p>
<p>previous Page, Group, Event or Instagram Profile was removed from the site </p>
<p>Evading the registration requirements outlined in our Terms of Service </p>
<p>Impersonate others by </p>
<p>Using their images with the explicit aim to deceive people </p>
<p>Creating a profile assuming the persona of or speaking for another person or </p>
<p>entity </p>
<p>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for </p>
<p>whom the user is not authorized to do so<span style="background-color: red;">. </p>
<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public</span>. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>

<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p></span>Do not post: </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Video<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>that ha</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> that have</span> been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity <span style="background-color: red;">or </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">or </span>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe<span style="background-color: green;">:</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>A</span><span style="background-color: red;">that a</span> subject of the video <span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>video, <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>word <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>"Remembering"<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>clear </span>that <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span>To <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain <span style="background-color: red;">content </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">content </span>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or </p>
<p>context to enforce: </p>
<p></span>When <span style="background-color: green;">brought to our attention by the legacy contact or a family member of the </p>
