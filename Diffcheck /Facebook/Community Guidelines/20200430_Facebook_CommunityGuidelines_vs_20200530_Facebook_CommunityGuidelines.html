<p><strong>1. Violence and Incitement</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I. Violence and Criminal Behavior</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on Facebook. </p>
<p>While we understand that people commonly express disdain or disagreement by </p>
<p>threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways, we remove language that </p>
<p>incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts, and </p>
<p>work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm </p>
<p>or direct threats to public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in </p>
<p>order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat </p>
<p>to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also </p>
<p>consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their </p>
<p>physical safety. </p>
<p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and </p>
<p>other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non </p>
<p>credible absent specific evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence) of any </p>
<p>target(s) where threat is defined as any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target and/or includes a visual of an armament to </p>
<p>represent violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for high-severity violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit high-severity violence </p>
<p>Content that asks or offers services for hire to kill others (for example, hitmen, </p>
<p>mercenaries, assassins) or advocates for the use of a hitman, mercenary or </p>
<p>assassin against a target. </p>
<p>Admissions, statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or </p>
<p>conditional statements to kidnap a target. </p>
<p>Threats that lead to serious injury (mid-severity violence) towards private individuals, </p>
<p>minor public figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups where threat is defined as </p>
<p>any of the following: </p>
<p>Statements of intent to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating violence; or </p>
<p>Calls for mid-severity violence including content where no target is specified </p>
<p>but a symbol represents the target; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence; or </p>
<p>Content about other target(s) apart from private individuals, minor public </p>
<p>figures, high risk persons, or high risk groups and any credible: </p>

<p>Calls for action of violence; or </p>
<p>Statements advocating for violence; or </p>
<p>Aspirational or conditional statements to commit violence </p>
<p>Threats that lead to physical harm (or other forms of lower-severity violence) towards </p>
<p>private individuals (self-reporting required) or minor public figures where threat is </p>

<p>a designated and recognizable at-risk group </p>
<p>Instructions on how to make or use weapons if there’s evidence of a goal to seriously </p>
<p>injure or kill people, through: </p>
<p>Language explicitly stating that goal, or </p>

<p></span> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to promote a safe environment on Facebook, we remove content that </p>
<p>encourages suicide or self-injury, including certain graphic imagery and real-time </p>
<p>depictions that experts tell us might lead others to engage in similar behavior. Self-</p>
<p>injury is defined as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-</p>
<p>mutilation and eating disorders. We want Facebook to be a space where people can </p>
<p>share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from </p>
<p>one another, which is why we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury. </p>
<p>We work with organizations around the world to provide assistance to people in </p>
<p>distress. We also talk to experts in suicide and self-injury to help inform our policies </p>
<p>and enforcement. For example, we have been advised by experts that we should not </p>
<p>remove live videos of self injury while there is an opportunity for loved ones and </p>
<p>authorities to provide help or resources. </p>
<p>In contrast, we remove any content that identifies and negatively targets victims or </p>
<p>survivors of self-injury or suicide seriously, humorously, or rhetorically. </p>
<p>Learn more about our suicide and self-injury policies and the resources that we </p>
<p>provide.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that promotes, encourages, coordinates, or provides instructions for </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Self-injury </p>
<p>Eating disorders </p>
<p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery </p>
<p>Except in limited situations of newsworthiness, it is against our policies to post </p>
<p>content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by suicide </p>
<p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave </p>
<p>stomach, or protruding spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated </p>
<p>with eating disorders. </p>
<p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared </p>
<p>together with terms associated with eating disorders. </p>
<p>For the following content, we restrict content to adults over the age of 18, and </p>
<p>include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware the content may be upsetting: </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person's death by suicide that are determined to </p>
<p>be newsworthy </p>
<p>Photos or videos depicting a person who engaged in euthanasia/assisted </p>
<p>suicide in a medical setting </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a sensitivity screen so that people are aware </p>
<p>the content may be upsetting to some: </p>
<p>Content that depicts older instances of self-harm such as healed cuts or other </p>
<p>non-graphic self-injury imagery in a context of recovery </p>
<p>Content that depicts ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or </p>
<p>protruding spine or scapula in a recovery context. </p>
<p>We provide resources to people who post written or verbal admissions of </p>
<p>engagement in self injury, including: </p>
<p>Suicide </p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted suicide </p>
<p>Self-harm </p>

<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Sexual Exploitation of Adults</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize the importance of Facebook as a place to discuss and draw attention </p>
<p>to sexual violence and exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation </p>
<p>and promote a safe environment, we allow victims to share their experiences, but </p>
<p>remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault, </p>
<p>or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for, or </p>
<p>coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-</p>
<p>consensual sexual acts. </p>
<p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual </p>
<p>violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. </p>
<p>As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and </p>
<p>improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may </p>
<p>remove content when they provide information that content is linked to harmful </p>
<p>activity. We’ve written about the technology we use to protect against intimate </p>
<p>images and the research that has informed our work. We’ve also put together </p>
<p>a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, </p>
<p>crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including: </p>
<p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or </p>
<p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or </p>
<p>Statements of intent, or </p>
<p>Calls for action, or </p>
<p>Threatening, soliciting, or stating an intent to share imagery, or </p>
<p>Admitting participation, or </p>
<p>Mocking victims of any of the above </p>
<p>Content that attempts to exploit people by any of the following: </p>
<p>Coercing money, favors, or images from people by threats of exposure of their </p>
<p>naked or semi-naked photos/videos </p>
<p>Sharing, threatening, stating an intent to share, offering or asking for </p>
<p>imagery known as "Revenge Porn" or “Non-Consensual Intimate Images” that </p>
<p>fulfills all three of the following conditions: </p>
<p>Image is non-commercial or produced in a private setting </p>
<p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a </p>
<p>sexual pose </p>
<p>Lack of consent to share the image is indicated by </p>
<p>Vengeful context (for example, caption, comments, or page title) </p>
<p>Independent sources (for example, law enforcement record) </p>
<p>including entertainment media (for example, leak of images </p>
<p>confirmed by media) </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image and </p>
<p>the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the same </p>
<p>name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Secretly taken non-commercial imagery of a real person's commonly </p>
<p>sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, or thighs) or of a real person </p>
<p>engaged in sexual activity. This imagery is commonly known as "creepshots" </p>
<p>or "upskirts" and includes photos or videos that mocks, sexualizes or exposes </p>
<p>the person depicted in the imagery. </p>
<p>Threatening or stating an intent to share private sexual conversations </p>
<p>that meets the following criteria: </p>
<p>Lack of consent is indicated by: </p>
<p>Vengeful context and/or threatening context, or </p>
<p>A visible match between the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>and the person who has reported the content to us </p>
<p>The person who reported the content to us shares the </p>
<p>same name as the person depicted in the image </p>
<p>Attempting to coordinate adult commercial sexual services or prostitution activities, </p>
<p>such as requesting or offering or asking for rates for escort services and paid sexual </p>
<p>fetish or domination services. </p>
<p>For the following content, we include a warning screen so that people are aware the </p>
<p>content may be disturbing: </p>
<p>Narratives and statements that contain a depiction of non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching (written or verbal) that includes details beyond mere naming or mentioning </p>
<p>the act if: </p>
<p>Shared by the victim, or </p>
<p>Shared by a third party (other than the victim) in support of victim or </p>
<p>condemnation of act or for general awareness to be determined by </p>
<p>context/caption </p>
<p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching </p>
<p><strong>9. Bullying and Harassment</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, </p>
<p>from making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending </p>
<p>threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate </p>
<p>this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on </p>
<p>Facebook. </p>
<p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to </p>
<p>allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are </p>
<p>featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we </p>
<p>remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is </p>
<p>directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes </p>
<p>further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for </p>
<p>example, claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and </p>
<p>harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our </p>
<p>policies provide heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18. </p>
<p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts if it is </p>
<p>clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying </p>
<p>and harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us </p>
<p>understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting </p>
<p>such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on </p>
<p>Facebook to help protect against it. </p>
<p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and </p>
<p>educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers </p>
<p>step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important conversations </p>
<p>about bullying. Learn more about what we’re doing to protect people from bullying </p>
<p>and harassment here. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Repeatedly contact someone in a manner that is: </p>
<p>Unwanted or </p>
<p>Sexually harassing or </p>
<p>Directed at a large number of individuals with no prior solicitation </p>

<p>exploitation, or domestic abuse </p>

<p><strong>10. Human Exploitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>II. Safety</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or </p>
<p>coordinates the exploitation of humans, including human trafficking. We define </p>
<p>human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of liberty for profit. It is the </p>
<p>exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex, labor, or </p>
<p>other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and </p>
<p>degrades humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or </p>
<p>materially benefiting others. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, </p>
<p>socioeconomic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. It takes many forms, and </p>
<p>any given trafficking situation can involve various stages of development. By the </p>
<p>coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent. </p>
<p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, the two </p>
<p>can be related and exhibit overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as </p>
<p>the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into a state across international </p>
<p>borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation </p>
<p>of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in </p>
<p>pursuit of a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on </p>
<p>movement, and human trafficking is a crime against a person, relying on exploitation. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content or exhibit behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any </p>
<p>of the following: </p>
<p>Sex Trafficking, covering minors and adults </p>
<p>The sale of children for illegal adoption </p>
<p>Orphanage Trafficking and Orphanage Volun-tourism </p>
<p>Forced Marriages </p>
<p>Labor Exploitation (incl. bonded labor) </p>
<p>Domestic Servitude </p>
<p>Non-regenerative Organ Trafficking </p>
<p>Forced Criminal Activity (e.g. forced begging, forced drug trafficking) </p>
<p>Recruitment of Child Soldiers </p>
<p>Content geared towards the: </p>
<p>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, </p>
<p>deception, blackmail or other non-consensual acts. </p>
<p>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, </p>
<p>harboring or brokering of victims prior or during the exploitation. </p>
<p>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting, or advocating for it. </p>
<p>Content that offers or assists in smuggling of humans<span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p>Except in limited cases of newsworthiness, content claimed or confirmed to come </p>
<p>from a hacked source, regardless of whether the affected person is a public figure or </p>
<p>a private individual. </p>
<p>Content that identifies individuals by name and depicts their personal information, </p>

<p>type of service and protection it offers through comments, posts, Pages or Groups: </p>
<p>Actual address of the safe house (post box only is allowed), </p>
<p>Images of the safe house, </p>

<p><strong>12. Hate Speech</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an environment of </p>
<p>intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote real-world violence. </p>
<p>We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected </p>
<p>characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual </p>
<p>orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. We </p>
<p>protect against attacks on the basis of age when age is paired with another protected </p>
<p>characteristic, andWe also provide certain some protections for immigration status. </p>
<p>We define attack as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or </p>
<p>calls for exclusion or segregation. We separate attacks into three tiers of severity, as </p>
<p>described below. </p>
<p>Sometimes people share content containing someone else’s hate speech for the </p>
<p>purpose of raising awareness or educating others. In some cases, words or terms </p>
<p>that might otherwise violate our standards are used self-referentially or in an </p>
<p>empowering way. People sometimes express contempt in the context of a romantic </p>
<p>break-up. Other times, they use gender-exclusive language to control membership in </p>
<p>a health or positive support group, such as a breastfeeding group for women only. In </p>
<p>all of these cases, we allow the content but expect people to clearly indicate their </p>
<p>intent, which helps us better understand why they shared it. Where the intention is </p>
<p>unclear, we may remove the content. </p>
<p>We allow humor and social commentary related to these topics. In addition, we </p>
<p>believe that people are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary </p>
<p>using their authentic identity. </p>
<p>Click here to read our Hard Questions Blog and learn more about our approach to </p>
<p>hate speech. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>

<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of </p>
<p>others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We </p>
<p>allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about </p>
<p>issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human </p>
<p>rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different </p>
<p>sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a </p>
<p>warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to </p>
<p>people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or </p>
<p>violent nature before they click to see it. </p>

<p>Videos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings if they depict </p>
<p>Dismemberment </p>

<p><strong>15. Sexual Solicitation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), </p>
<p>people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and </p>
<p>exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. </p>
<p>We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates </p>
<p>sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that </p>
<p>may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may </p>
<p>be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to </p>
<p>connect with their friends and the broader community. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Attempted coordination of or recruitment for adult sexual activities, including but not </p>
<p>limited to: </p>
<p>Filmed sexual activities </p>
<p>Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances </p>
<p>Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages </p>
<p>Explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the following, offering or </p>
<p>asking for: </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners </p>
<p>Sex chat or conversations </p>
<p>Nude photos<span style="background-color: green;">/</span><span style="background-color: red;">, </span>videos<span style="background-color: green;">/</span><span style="background-color: red;"> or </span>imagery </p>
<p>Content that <span style="background-color: green;">is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and </p>
<p></span>meets both of the following criteria<span style="background-color: green;">. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be </p>
<p>violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but </p>
<p>does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating</span>: </p>
<p>Criteria 1: Offer or Ask </p>
<p>Content implicitly or indirectly<strong>*</strong> (typically through providing a method of </p>
<p>contact) offers or asks for: </p>
<p>Nude imagery, or </p>
<p>Sex or sexual partners, or </p>
<p>Sex chat conversations </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span>Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements </p>
<p>Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the </p>
<p>following sexually suggestive elements: </p>
<p>Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji </p>
<p>strings, or </p>
<p>Regional sexualized slang, or </p>
<p>Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, </p>
<p>digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, </p>
<p>fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or </p>
<p>activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or </p>
<p>Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, </p>
<p>objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude </p>
<p>butts<span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p>Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or </p>
<p>asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. </p>
<p>For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not </p>
<p>ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating.</span> </p>
<p>An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links </p>
<p>to external pornographic websites) </p>
<p>Sexually explicit language that goes into graphic detail beyond mere reference to: </p>
<p>A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) or </p>
<p>An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising </p>
<p>fetish scenarios) </p>
<p><strong>16. Cruel and Insensitive</strong> </p>
<p><strong>III. Objectionable Content</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their implied or </p>
<p>premature death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual </p>
<p>touching, domestic violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>We remove explicit attempts to mock victims and mark as cruel implicit attempts, </p>
<p>many of which take the form of memes and GIFs.  </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Content that depicts real people and laughs at or makes fun of their premature </p>
<p>death, serious or fatal disease or disability, starvation, physical violence, domestic </p>
<p>violence, or serious physical injury </p>
<p>Content that contains sadistic remarks and any visual or written depiction of real </p>
<p>people experiencing premature death, serious physical injury, physical violence or </p>
<p>domestic violence. </p>
<p>Imagery that depicts real animals that are visibly experiencing and being laughed at, </p>
<p>made fun of, or contain sadistic remarks for any of the following (except staged </p>
<p>animal vs. animal fights or animal fights in the wild): </p>
<p>premature death </p>
<p>serious physical injury (including mutilation) </p>
<p>physical violence from a human </p>

<p></span><strong>17. Misrepresentation</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Misrepresent your identity by </p>
<p>Using a name that does not abide by our name policies<span style="background-color: green;">(not applicable to </p>
<p>Instagram)</span> </p>

<p>Posting imagery that is likely to deceive the public as to the content's origin, if: </p>
<p>The entity or an authorized representative objects to the content, and </p>
<p>Can establish a risk of harm to members of the public. </p>
<p><strong>18. Spam</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content </p>
<p>that is designed to deceive, or that attempts to mislead users to increase viewership. </p>
<p>This content creates a negative user experience and detracts from people's ability to </p>
<p>engage authentically in online communities. We also aim to prevent people from </p>
<p>abusing our platform, products, or features to artificially increase viewership or </p>
<p>distribute content en masse for commercial gain. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Post, share, engage with content, or create accounts, groups, pages, events </p>
<p>or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies. </p>
<p>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy, or exchange site privileges or product </p>
<p>features, such as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, pages, groups, </p>
<p>likes, etc., except in the case of clearly identified branded content, as defined </p>
<p>by our Branded Content Policy. </p>
<p>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking, </p>
<p>sharing) before they are able to view or interact with promised content. </p>
<p>Encourage likes, shares, follows, clicks, or the use of apps or websites under </p>
<p>false pretenses, such as: </p>
<p>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality (e.g., “Get a </p>
<p>‘Dislike’ button!”) </p>
<p>Failing to direct to promised content (e.g., “Click here for a discount </p>
<p>code at Nordstrom”; false play buttons) </p>
<p>Directing users off of Facebook through the deceptive or misleading </p>
<p>use of URLs, defined as: </p>
<p><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Presenting different content to Facebook users and </p>
<p>Facebook crawlers or tools. </p>
<p><strong>Misleading content:</strong> Content contains a link that promises one </p>
<p>type of content but delivers something substantially different. </p>
<p>Deceptive Pop-up websites: Websites that require an action </p>
<p>(captcha, watch ad, click here) in order to view the expected </p>
<p>landing page content and the domain name of the URL changes </p>
<p>after the required action is complete. </p>
<p><strong>Like / Share-Gating</strong>: Landing pages that require users to like, </p>
<p>share, or otherwise engage with content before gaining access </p>
<p>to off-Facebook content. </p>
<p><strong>Deceptive Landing Page Functionality</strong>: Websites that have a </p>
<p>misleading user interface, which results in accidental traffic </p>
<p>being generated (pop-ups/unders, clickjacking, etc.) </p>
<p><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The website pretends to be a reputable brand </p>
<p>or service by usin </p>
<p>g a name, domain, or content featuring </p>
<p>typos, misspellings, or other means to impersonate well-known </p>
<p>brands (e.g. www.faceb00k.com, www.face_book.com, using a </p>
<p>landing page similar to another, trusted site to mislead visitors). </p>
<p>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to those listed </p>
<p>above. </p>
<p><strong>19. Cybersecurity</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>We recognize that the safety of our users extends to the security of their personal </p>
<p>information. Attempts to gather sensitive personal information by deceptive or </p>
<p>invasive methods are harmful to the authentic, open, and safe atmosphere that we </p>
<p>want to foster. Therefore, we do not allow attempts to gather sensitive user </p>
<p>information through the abuse of our platform and products. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Attempt to compromise user accounts or gather sensitive information through </p>
<p>unauthorized means, defined as: </p>
<p>Gaining access to any account or user data other than your own without </p>
<p>explicit permission from the account owner. </p>
<p>Encouraging or deceiving users and entities to download or run files or </p>
<p>programs that will compromise a user’s online or data security. Such files and </p>
<p>programs will be deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain </p>
<p>unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network. </p>
<p>Acquiring or requesting another user’s login credentials, whether explicitly or </p>
<p>through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys designed to </p>
<p>capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites). </p>
<p>Attempting to obtain the sensitive information of others such as usernames, </p>
<p>passwords, or other personal information, through deceptive means or the </p>
<p>use of malicious software or websites. </p>
<p>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information on platform or through a </p>
<p>third party service. </p>
<p>Creating, sharing, or hosting malicious software or malicious browser </p>
<p>extensions to compromise accounts or gain access to user data. </p>
<p>Providing online infrastructure, including Web Hosting Services, Domain </p>
<p>Name System servers, and ad networks that enables abusive links such that </p>
<p>a majority of those links on Facebook or Instagram violate the Spam or </p>
<p>Cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </p>
<p><strong>20. Inauthentic Behavior</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we don't allow people to misrepresent </p>
<p>themselves on Facebook, use fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of </p>
<p>content, or engage in behaviors designed to enable other violations under our </p>
<p>Community Standards. This policy is intended to create a space where people can </p>
<p>trust the people and communities they interact with. </p>
<p>Do not: </p>
<p>Use multiple Facebook accounts or share accounts between multiple people </p>
<p>Misuse Facebook or Instagram reporting systems to harass others </p>
<p>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control </p>
<p>of that Page </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Inauthentic Behavior, which is defined as the </p>
<p>use of Facebook or Instagram assets (accounts, pages, groups, or events), to </p>
<p>mislead people or Facebook: </p>
<p>about the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent </p>
<p>about the popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets </p>
<p>about the purpose of an audience or community </p>
<p>about the source or origin of content </p>
<p>to evade enforcement under our Community Standards </p>
<p>Engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined </p>
<p>as the use of multiple Facebook or Instagram assets, working in concert to </p>
<p>engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined above), where the use of fake </p>
<p>accounts is central to the operation </p>
<p>Engage in or claim to engage in Foreign or Government Interference, which is </p>
<p>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or </p>
<p>government actor. </p>
<p><strong>21. False news</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy rationale </p>
<p>Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take </p>
<p>seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want </p>
<p>to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is </p>
<p>also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we </p>
<p>don't remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its </p>
<p>distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to </p>
<p>reduce the spread of false news here. </p>
<p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false </p>
<p>news in a number of different ways, namely by </p>
<p>Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that </p>
<p>propagate misinformation </p>
<p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a </p>
<p>machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false </p>
<p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party </p>
<p>fact-checkers </p>
<p>Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by </p>
<p>informing them with more context and promoting news literacy </p>
<p>Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this </p>
<p>challenging issue </p>
<p><strong>22. Manipulated Media</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>Media, including image, audio, or video, can be edited in a variety of ways. In many </p>
<p>cases, these changes are benign, like a filter effect on a photo. In other cases, the </p>
<p>manipulation isn’t apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video </p>
<p>content. We aim to remove this category of manipulated media when the criteria laid </p>
<p>out below have been met. </p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to invest in partnerships (including with journalists, </p>
<p>academics and independent fact-checkers) to help us reduce the distribution of false </p>
<p>news and misinformation, as well as to better inform people about the content they </p>
<p>encounter online. </p>
<p>Do not post: </p>
<p>Video </p>
<p>that has been edited or synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or </p>
<p>quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person, and would </p>
<p>likely mislead an average person to believe that a subject of the video </p>
<p>said words that they did not say AND </p>
<p>is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including </p>
<p>deep learning techniques (e.g., a technical deepfake), that merges, </p>
<p>combines, replaces, and/or superimposes content onto a video, </p>
<p>creating a video that appears authentic. </p>
<p>This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire or is edited to </p>
<p>omit words that were said or change the order of words that were said. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>23. Memorialization</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IV. Integrity and Authenticity</strong> </p>
<p>Policy Rationale </p>
<p>When someone passes away, friends and family can request that </p>
<p>we memorialize the Facebook account. Once memorialized, the </p>
<p>word "Remembering"appears above the name on the person's profile to help make it </p>
<p>clear that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins </p>
<p>and fraudulent activity. To respect the choices someone made while alive, we aim to </p>
<p>preserve their account after they pass away. We have also made it possible for </p>
<p>people to identify a legacy contact to look after their account after they pass away.To </p>
<p>support the bereaved, in some instances we may remove or change certain content </p>
<p>when the legacy contact or family members request it. </p>
<p>Visit Hard Questions for more information about our memorialization policy and </p>
<p>process. And see our Newsroom for the latest tools we're building to support people </p>
<p>during these difficult times. </p>
<p>For victims of murder and suicide we will remove the following content if it appears </p>
<p>on the deceased’s profile photo, cover photo, or among recent timeline posts when </p>
<p>requested by a legacy contact or family member of the deceased: </p>
<p>Visual depiction of the object used in the deceased’s death </p>
<p>Imagery of the convicted or alleged murderer of the deceased </p>
<p>Content related to the deceased’s death </p>
<p>For victims of murder, we will also remove the convicted or alleged murderer from </p>
<p>the deceased’s profile if referenced in relationship status or among friends. </p>
