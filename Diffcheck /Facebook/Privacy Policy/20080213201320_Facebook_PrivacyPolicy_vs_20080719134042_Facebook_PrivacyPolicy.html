<p>This policy is effective as of December 6, 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Principles</strong></p>
<p>We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may</p>
<p>not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you control of your</p>
<p>information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your networks and other</p>
<p>reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.</p>
<p>Facebook follows two core principles:</p>
<p><strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in</p>
<p>your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control the users</p>
<p>with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the <span style="background-color: red;">My </span>Privacy page.</p>
<p><strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong> </p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your</p>
<p>friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with</p>
<p>whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please send them to privacy@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook's Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide</p>
<p>to share, and help you make informed decisions when using Facebook, located at www.facebook.com and its directly</p>
<p>associated domains (collectively, "Facebook" or "Website")</p>
<p>By using or accessing Facebook, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Facebook is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is</p>
<p>to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy</p>
<p>statement covers the site www.facebook.com and its directly associated domains. Because this Web site wants to</p>
<p>demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy</p>
<p>practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our privacy staff</p>
<p>at privacy@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been<span style="background-color: red;"> satisfactorily</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">satisfactorily </span>addressed, you should contact TRUSTe Watchdog<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>concerns.</p>
<p><strong>EU Safe Harbor Participation</strong></p>
<p>We participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part</p>
<p>of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our</p>
<p>compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe</p>
<p>Harbor you should first contact us at info@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>. If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise</p>
<p>your complaint with TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you visit Facebook you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to</p>
<p>disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email</p>
<p>address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference</p>
<p>information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Facebook</p>
<p>visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on</p>
<p>the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.</p>
<p>These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID</p>
<p>(but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Facebook. You can remove or block this</p>
<p>cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and</p>
<p>queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this</p>
<p>information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for</p>
<p>instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information,</p>
<p>we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version</p>
<p>of that information.</p>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Facebook Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set</p>
<p>privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We</p>
<p>cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we</p>
<p>cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are</p>
<p>not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and</p>
<p>acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if</p>
<p>other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Facebook is a violation of the Facebook Terms of Service and</p>
<p>should be reported to privacy@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the</p>
<p>invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message</p>
<p>inviting him or her to visit the site. Facebook stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend</p>
<p>connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us</p>
<p>at info@facebook.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging</p>
<p>services, and other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide</p>
<p>you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow</p>
<p>such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Facebook or send any information about</p>
<p>yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any</p>
<p>personal information to or on Facebook. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child</p>
<p>under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe</p>
<p>that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>.</p>
<p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about</p>
<p>themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your</p>
<p>name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect</p>
<p>with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new</p>
<p>services offered by Facebook that we think you may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service</p>
<p>and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your</p>
<p>privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the</p>
<p>networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).</p>
<p>Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network</p>
<p>and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your</p>
<p>friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access</p>
<p>your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that</p>
<p>allows such access based on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For</p>
<p>instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an email alerting</p>
<p>you to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, you may opt out of such emails<span style="background-color: green;"> from the</span> <span style="background-color: red;">her</span><span style="background-color: green;">Notifications pag</span>e, though Facebook reserves the right to send you<span style="background-color: red;"> notices about your</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">notices about your </span>account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for</p>
<p>purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and</p>
<p>promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around</p>
<p>you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite</p>
<p>movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we</p>
<p>don't tell the movie company who you are.</p>
<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet</p>
<p>sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers and other users of Facebook, to</p>
<p>supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you</p>
<p>do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g.,</p>
<p>removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with</p>
<p>privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information you</p>
<p>provide to friends and networks through Facebook. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make</p>
<p>informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not provide contact information to third party</p>
<p>marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we</p>
<p>believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>Your <span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">N</span>ews <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed and <span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">M</span>ini-<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and </span>network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your <span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">N</span>ews <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed and<span style="background-color: red;"> m</span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>M</span>ini-<span style="background-color: green;">F</span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>f</span>eed<span style="background-color: green;"> on your</span> <span style="background-color: green;">P</span><span style="background-color: red;">he</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ivacy pag</span>e.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine "crawlers"</p>
<p>(e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal information</p>
<p>beyond your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use</p>
<p>third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out</p>
<p>email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for</p>
<p>products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including</p>
<p>sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access</p>
<p>to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize</p>
<p>third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical</p>
<p>protections limiting the use of that information to the Facebook-specified purposes.</p>
<p>If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using the Facebook</p>
<p>Platform ("Platform Applications"), those Platform Applications may access and share certain information about you</p>
<p>with others in accordance with your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information</p>
<p>through Platform Applications on the Privacy Settings page. In addition, third party developers who have created</p>
<p>and operate Platform Applications ("Platform Developers"), may also have access to your personal information</p>
<p>(excluding your contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any</p>
<p>Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Facebook requires the Platform Developer to</p>
<p>enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly</p>
<p>limits their collection, use, and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and</p>
<p>technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we of course cannot</p>
<p>and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that Facebook does</p>
<p>not screen or approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal</p>
<p>information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform Developers may</p>
<p>require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them</p>
<p>additional rights or impose additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms and policies</p>
<p>carefully before using any Platform Application. You can report any suspected misuse of information through the</p>
<p>Facebook Platform and we will investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Platform</p>
<p>Developer up to and including terminating their participation in the Facebook Platform and/or other formal legal</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such</p>
<p>accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit</p>
<p>possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or</p>
<p>in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an</p>
<p>information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may</p>
<p>share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or</p>
<p>property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook</p>
<p>name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers,</p>
<p>agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored</p>
<p>groups or other on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another</p>
<p>company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with</p>
<p>that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a</p>
<p>purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear</p>
<p>disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on</p>
<p>Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on</p>
<p>that site. You have the choice to have Facebook discard that information, or to share it with your friends.</p>
<p>To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the</p>
<p>service altogether, click here.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are</p>
<p>logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the</p>
<p>technical operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives information on users that are not logged in, or</p>
<p>on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can</p>
<p>continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the</p>
<p>promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your</p>
<p>network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or other information,</p>
<p>may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done</p>
<p>at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments,</p>
<p>messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or other items , this information may become publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Facebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites.</p>
<p>We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site</p>
<p>that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers.</p>
<p>They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to</p>
<p>your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the</p>
<p>effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize</p>
<p>your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to</p>
<p>personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or</p>
<p>browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access to or</p>
<p>control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your</p>
<p>contact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking</p>
<p>technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.</p>
<p>Facebook users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information</p>
<p>will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the My</p>
<p>Account page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally</p>
<p>available to members of Facebook.</p>
<p>Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Facebook,</p>
<p>however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Facebook user) you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured</p>
<p>server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt</p>
<p>that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go</p>
<p>to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure</p>
<p>communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you</p>
<p>have any questions about the security of Facebook Web Site, please contact us at privacy@facebook.com</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong></p>
<p>Your use of Facebook, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all</p>
<p>of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to</p>
<p>change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect</p>
<p>immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will</p>
<p>post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this</p>
<p>policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on</p>
<p>an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy</p>
<p>applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
