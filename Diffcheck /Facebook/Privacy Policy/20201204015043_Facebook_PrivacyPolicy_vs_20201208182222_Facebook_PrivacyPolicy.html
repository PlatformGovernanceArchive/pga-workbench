<p><strong>Content that others share or reshare about you.</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>

<p>on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a post or</p>
<p>send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download,</p>
<p>screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products,</p>
<p>in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>

<p><strong>Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you</p>
<p>use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it</p>
<p>with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or</p>
<p>information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends</p>
<p>and followers may, of course, choose to share this information</p>
<p>themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is</p>
<p>subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information that you choose to share with them,</p>
<p>including information that your friends share with you, so they can</p>
<p>provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version,</p>
<p>we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>
<p>address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with third-party partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't</p>
<p>sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the</p>
<p>types of third parties that we share information with: </p>

<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and</p>
<p>businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,</p>
<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>
<p>information about the number of people or accounts who viewed,</p>
<p>reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate</p>
<p>demographic and other information that helps them understand</p>
<p>interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing</p>
<p>their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you (information such as your</p>
<p>name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or</p>
<p>identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34</p>
<p>who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you</p>
<p>to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>

<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>

<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on</p>
<p>its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>How can I manage or delete information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook settings and Instagram settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected</p>
<p>and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete</p>
<p>that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of</p>
<p>content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your</p>
<p>photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover this information later.</p>
<p>Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be</p>
<p>deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the</p>
<p>Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time,</p>
<p>please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>

<p>How do we respond to legal requests or</p>
<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognised standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and</p>
<p>address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or</p>
<p>Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our</p>
<p>rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or</p>
<p>regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if</p>
<p>relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other</p>
<p>harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to</p>
<p>purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period</p>
<p>when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or</p>
<p>investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent</p>
<p>harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term breaches for at least a</p>
<p>year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches.</p>

<p>How do we operate and transfer data as</p>
<p>part of our global services?</p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world</p>
<p>in accordance with this Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms,</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilise standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>

<p>How will we notify you of changes to this</p>
<p>Policy?</p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to</p>
<p>review the revised Policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
