<p><strong>Facebookʼs Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>Date of last revision: December 9, 2009.</p>
<p>We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Facebook works. You should read this policy in its entirety, but should</p>
<p>pay particular attention to these four highlights:<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want. You decide how much</strong></p>
<p><strong>information you feel comfortable sharing on Facebook and you control how it is distributed through your</strong><strong>privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings</strong><strong>. You should review the default</strong><strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences. You</strong></p>
<p><strong>should also consider your settings whenever you share information.</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is not just a website. It is also a service for sharing your information on Facebook-enhanced applications and</strong></p>
<p><strong>websites. You can control how you share information with those third-party applications and websites through</strong></p>
<p><strong>your</strong><strong>application settings</strong><strong>and you can learn more about how information is shared with them on our</strong><strong>About</strong></p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong><strong>page. You can also limit how your friends share your information with applications through your</strong><strong>privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p></span><strong>Certain categories of information such as your name, profile photo, list of friends and pages you are a fan of, gender,</strong></p>
<p><strong>geographic region, and networks you belong to are considered publicly available to everyone, including Facebook-</strong></p>
<p><strong>enhanced applications, and therefore do not have</strong><strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>. You can, however, limit the ability of others to find</strong></p>
<p><strong>this information through search using your search</strong><strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>.</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your information with advertisers</strong></p>
<p><strong>without your consent. We allow advertisers to select characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to</strong></p>
<p><strong>and we use the information we have collected to serve those advertisements.</strong></p>
<p>This policy contains eight sections, and you can jump to each by selecting the links below:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Information You Share With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong><strong>How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong><strong>How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.</strong><strong>How We Protect Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>Other Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions.</strong> If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, contact our privacy team through this help page. You</p>
<p>may also contact us by mail at 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304.</p>
<p><strong>TRUSTe Program.</strong> Facebook is a certified licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. This means that our privacy policy and</p>
<p>practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe, an independent organization focused on reviewing privacy and security policies and</p>
<p>practices, for compliance with its strict program requirements. This privacy policy covers the website www.facebook.com. The</p>
<p>TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover other information, such as</p>
<p>information that may be collected through software downloaded from Facebook.</p>
<p>If you have any complaints about our policy or practices please let us know through this help page . If you are not satisfied with</p>
<p>our response, you can contact TRUSTe.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor.</strong> Facebook also adheres to the Safe Harbor framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the</p>
<p>European Union. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor, we agree to resolve all disputes you have with us in connection</p>
<p>with our policies and practices through TRUSTe. To view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe</p>
<p>Harbor Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Scope.</strong>This privacy policy covers all of Facebook. It does not, however, apply to entities that Facebook does not own or control,</p>
<p>such as Facebook-enhanced applications and websites. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to our privacy practices</p>
<p>outlined here.</p>
<p><strong>No information from children under age 13.</strong> If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for Facebook or provide</p>
<p>any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13,</p>
<p>we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13,</p>
<p>please contact us through this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Parental participation.</strong>We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before</p>
<p>sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe</p>
<p>internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children about safe internet use can be found on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal information.</strong> When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the</p>
<p>registration process we give you the opportunity to provide additional profile information, such as where you went to school and</p>
<p>where you work, and to add a picture of yourself, to help your friends connect with you. In some cases we may ask for additional</p>
<p>information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can visit your profile at any time to</p>
<p>add or remove personal information about yourself. You can add basic information about yourself, such as information about your</p>
<p>hometown, family, relationships, and your political and religious views. You can also add other information about yourself</p>
<p>including your activities, interests, contact information, as well as more information about your education and job history.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong>One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your</p>
<p>status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write</p>
<p>something on someoneʼs Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with</p>
<p>content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong>We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook. However, we will only</p>
<p>keep your payment source account number with your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friendsʼ addresses so that you can find your friends</p>
<p>on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have Facebook accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information,</p>
<p>visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have</p>
<p>uploaded your contactsʼ information.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information.</strong>When you share your location with others or add a location to something you post, we treat that like any</p>
<p>other content you post (for example, it is subject to your privacy settings). If we offer a service that supports this type of location</p>
<p>sharing we will present you with an opt-in choice of whether you want to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding a friend, becoming a fan of a</p>
<p>Facebook Page, joining a group or an event, creating a photo album, sending a gift, poking another user, indicating you “like” a</p>
<p>post, attending an event, or authorizing an application. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information</p>
<p>or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact</p>
<p>you shared it.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may</p>
<p>collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong>We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile</p>
<p>phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For</p>
<p>example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back</p>
<p>to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook</p>
<p>Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies</p>
<p>using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect.</strong>We do not own or operate the applications that you use through Facebook Platform</p>
<p>(such as games and utilities) or the websites that you interact with through Facebook Connect. We refer to them as “Facebook-</p>
<p>enhanced” applications and websites because they use our Platform to provide you with social features. Whenever you authorize a</p>
<p>Facebook-enhanced application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take.</p>
<p>In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you</p>
<p>authorize the application or website.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong>We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share</p>
<p>information with us:<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other</li>
</ul>
<p>users who didnʼt see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure</p>
<p>our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may receive information about whether or not youʼve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure</li>
</ul>
<p>the effectiveness of those ads.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop</p>
<p>associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we</p>
<p>explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you</p>
<p>in a photo or video, provides friend details, or indicates a relationship with you. You can limit who can see that you have been</p>
<p>tagged in a photo or video – which we refer to as photos or videos “of me” – in your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>3. Information You Share With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that others use information that you share on Facebook in a manner consistent with your privacy settings,</p>
<p>but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules. Read the following section to learn more about how you can protect</p>
<p>yourself when you share information with third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing information on Facebook.</strong> We designed our privacy settings to enable you to control how you share your information on</p>
<p>Facebook. You should review the default privacy settings to make sure they reflect your preferences. Here are some specific things</p>
<p>to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can control the visibility of most of the information you share on Facebook through the privacy settings you select.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain categories of information such as your name, profile photo, list of friends and pages you are a fan of, gender, geographic</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>region, and networks you belong to are considered publicly available, and therefore do not have privacy settings. You can limit the</p>
<p>ability of others to find this information on third party search engines through your search</span> <span style="background-color: green;">privacy settings.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friendsʼ home pages and other pages they visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was</p>
<p>copied or stored by other users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You understand that information might be re-shared or copied by other users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p></span>Certain <span style="background-color: red;">ca</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">egories of information such as </span>y<span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">our nam</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">s of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">suc</span><span style="background-color: red;">profile p</span>h<span style="background-color: green;"> as messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">u p</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">st information on another userʼs profile or comment on another userʼs post</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">lis</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> of friends and pages you are a fan of, gender, geograp</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ic</p>

<p>other userʼs </span>privacy settings.<span style="background-color: red;"> You can limit the</p>
<p>ability of others to find this information on third party search engines through your search privacy settings. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friendsʼ home pages and other pages they visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was</p>
<p>copied or stored by other users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You understand that information might be re-shared or copied by other users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you post information on another userʼs profile or comment on another userʼs post, that information will be subject to the</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>other userʼs privacy settings. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you use an external source to publish information to Facebook (such as a mobile application or a Connect site), you should</li>
</ul>
<p>check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.</p>
<p><strong>“Everyone” Privacy Setting.</strong> Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, may be accessed by everyone on the</p>
<p>Internet (including people not logged into Facebook), is subject to indexing by third party search engines, may be associated with</p>
<p>you outside of Facebook (such as when you visit other sites on the internet), and may be imported and exported by us and others</p>
<p>without privacy limitations. The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.”</p>
<p>You can review and change the default settings in your privacy settings. If you delete “everyone” content that you posted on</p>
<p>Facebook, we will remove it from your Facebook profile, but have no control over its use outside of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Facebook-enhanced applications or websites. That means</p>
<p>that when you visit Facebook-enhanced applications and websites you are making your Facebook information available to</p>
<p>someone other than Facebook. To help those applications and sites operate, they receive publicly available information</p>
<p>automatically when you visit them, and additional information when you formally authorize or connect your Facebook account with</p>
<p>them. You can learn more details about which information the operators of those applications and websites can access on</p>
<p>our About Platform page. Prior to allowing them to access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit</p>
<p>their use of your information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and we use</p>
<p>technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized information. We also give you tools to control how your information</p>
<p>is shared with them:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">[You can choose to opt</span>-<span style="background-color: red;"> You can choose to opt-</span>out of Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect altogether through your privacy settings<span style="background-color: green;">]</span> <span style="background-color: green;"> (We will remove</p>
<p>this sentence in the next revision to our Privacy Policy as the product has changed)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can block specific applications from accessing your information by visiting your application settings or the applicationʼs</li>
</ul>
<p>“About” page</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use your privacy settings to limit which of your information is available to “everyone” (by default, every application and</li>
</ul>
<p>website, including those you have not connected with, can access “everyone” and other publicly available content)<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<ul>
<li>You can use your</span> <span style="background-color: green;">application settings to limit which of your information your friends can make available to applications and</li>
</ul>
<p>websites</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: green;">We may make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to Facebook –enhanced</li>
</ul>
<p>applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-</p>
<p>appropriate content.</p>
<p></span>You <span style="background-color: red;">can u</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">e y</span>ou<span style="background-color: green;">ld always </span>r<span style="background-color: green;">eview the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in</p>
<p>which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or</p>
<p>website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this</span> <span style="background-color: red;">application settings to limit w</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ich of your information your fri</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nds can make avai</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">able to a</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">plications</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and</p>

</ul>
<p>applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-</p>
<p>appropriate content. </p>
<p>You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in</p>
<p>which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or</p>
<p>website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this help page </span>and we will take action as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Exporting Information.</strong> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone</p>
<p>address books, or copy and paste functions, to capture and export information from Facebook, including your information and</p>
<p>information about you.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure the effectiveness</p>
<p>of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may opt-out of the placement of cookies by many of these</p>
<p>advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising</p>
<p>networks.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites,</p>
<p>and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on</p>
<p>how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve</p>
<p>those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal</p>
<p>activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. For example, we ask for your date of birth to verify that you</p>
<p>are over age 13 and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. We also</p>
<p>use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as</p>
<p>spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all</p>
<p>communications except essential updates on your account notifications page. We may include content you see on Facebook in the</p>
<p>emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We donʼt share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example</p>
<p>of consent would be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow</p>
<p>advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally</p>
<p>identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your</p>
<p>birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For</p>
<p>example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment</p>
<p>company who you are. You can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not</p>
<p>share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there</p>
<p>is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>To serve social ads.</strong>We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends</p>
<p>to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends. For example, if you become a fan of a Page,</p>
<p>we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that Page that is displayed to your friends. We only share</p>
<p>the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your</p>
<p>information used in social ads on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your</p>
<p>profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update). In such cases we generally allow you to direct</p>
<p>how that information is shared in your privacy settings or give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to</p>
<p>remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>To make Suggestions.</strong> We use your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers, and other</p>
<p>relevant information, to help you connect with your friends, including making suggestions to you and other users that you connect</p>
<p>with on Facebook. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other people, you can adjust your search</p>
<p>visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the extent you choose to be visible in public search</p>
<p>listings. You may also block specific individual users from being suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and</p>
<p>photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the</p>
<p>information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If</p>
<p>we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you</p>
<p>provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the userʼs account. In such cases we</p>
<p>restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to write on the userʼs Wall in remembrance. We may close</p>
<p>an account if we receive a formal request from the userʼs next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p>
<p><strong>5. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with privacy</p>
<p>settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information with third parties</p>
<p>when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><strong>When you make a payment.</strong> When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Facebook, we will only share</p>
<p>transaction information with those third parties necessary to complete the transaction and will require those third parties to agree</p>
<p>to respect the privacy of your information.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>When you invite a friend to join.</strong> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook, we will send your friend a message on your</p>
<p>behalf using your name. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If your friend does not want us to keep</p>
<p>their information, we will remove it at their request on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</strong> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic</p>
<p>commerce providers that are not associated with Facebook through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will</p>
<p>not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results</p>
<p>on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can control who has access to this information, as well as who can find</p>
<p>you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users</p>
<p>identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote Facebook to those users.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search enginesʼ access to our site. We may</p>
<p>allow them to access information set to the “everyone” setting and your public search listing (but you can turn off your public</p>
<p>search listing in your privacy settings).<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service.</strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or</p>
<p>promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For</p>
<p>example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Facebook, remove repetitive</p>
<p>information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service</p>
<p>providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable</p>
<p>contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.</p>
<p><strong>To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them</p>
<p>to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook</p>
<p>Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the</p>
<p>partner and present the joint service providerʼs privacy policy to you before you use that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other</p>
<p>requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include</p>
<p>respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required</p>
<p>by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted</p>
<p>international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other</p>
<p>illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and</p>
<p>Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Beacon.</strong> [We have announced a settlement of a lawsuit related to the Beacon product: the Beacon product will be</p>
<p>discontinued and this language removed from the privacy policy upon approval of a settlement by the court.] Facebook Beacon is a</p>
<p>means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a purchase or post a review, with your</p>
<p>friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on</p>
<p>third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it</p>
<p>to you after you have completed an action on that site. You have the choice to have us discard that information, or to share it with</p>
<p>your friends. To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the</p>
<p>service altogether, click here. Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even</p>
<p>if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical</p>
<p>operation of the system. In cases where we receive information from Beacon sites on users that are not logged in, or on non-</p>
<p>Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may</p>
<p>transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would</p>
<p>remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Viewing and editing your profile.</strong> You may change or delete your profile information at any time by going to your profile page</p>
<p>and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately. While you cannot delete your date of birth, you can use the</p>
<p>setting on the info tab of your profile information page to hide all or part of it from other users.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you</p>
<p>deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information (friends, photos,</p>
<p>interests, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and</p>
<p>in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate</p>
<p>your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete</p>
<p>your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account settings page or</p>
<p>delete your account on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information</p>
<p>may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy</p>
<p>settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on</p>
<p>Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another userʼs profile, and then you delete your account, that post may remain,</p>
<p>but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”) Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and</p>
<p>other misconduct even if deletion has been requested.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to</p>
<p>others.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to</p>
<p>delete your address, you can do so on this help page. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the</p>
<p>request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>7. How We Protect Information</strong></p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on</p>
<p>Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When</p>
<p>you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket</p>
<p>layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for</p>
<p>fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove</p>
<p>inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights</p>
<p>and Responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please</p>
<p>be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share</p>
<p>your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information</p>
<p>you share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy</p>
<p>settings or security measures on Facebook. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as</p>
<p>choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on this help page.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>8. Other Terms</strong><span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong>. We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Facebook Statement of Rights and</p>
<p>Responsibilities. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your</p>
<p>account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here and on the Facebook Site Governance</p>
<p>Page. You can make sure that you receive notice directly by becoming a fan of the Facebook Site Governance Page.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States.</strong> By using Facebook, you consent to having your personal data</p>
<p>transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Defined Terms.</strong> "Us," "we," "our," "Platform" and "Facebook" mean the same as they do in the Statement of Rights and</p>
<p>Responsibilities. “Information” and “content” are used more generally and interchangeably here than in the Statement of Rights</p>
<p>and Responsibilities unless otherwise limited by the context.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
