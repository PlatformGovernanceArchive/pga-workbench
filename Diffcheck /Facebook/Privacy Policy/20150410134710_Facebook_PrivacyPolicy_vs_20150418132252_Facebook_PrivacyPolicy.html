<p><strong>How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about creating engaging and customized experiences for people. We</p>
<p>use all of the information we have to help us provide and support our Services. Here’s</p>
<p>how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, improve and develop Services.</strong></p>
<p>We are able to deliver our Services, personalize content, and make</p>
<p>suggestions for you by using this information to understand how you</p>
<p>use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re</p>
<p>connected to and interested in on and off our Services. </p>
<p>We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions</p>
<p>to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in</p>
<p>a picture by comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put</p>
<p>together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've</p>
<p>been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether</p>
<p>we suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline</p>
<p>and Tagging” settings. </p>
<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for</p>
<p>you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or</p>
<p>offers in your area or tell your friends that you are nearby. </p>
<p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and</p>
<p>analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and</p>
<p>services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and</p>
<p>troubleshooting activities.</p>

<p>We use your information to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our</p>
<p>policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you</p>
<p>when you contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Show and measure ads and services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to improve our advertising and</p>
<p>measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our</p>
<p>Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services.</p>
<p>Learn more about advertising on our Services and how you can control</p>
<p>how information about you is used to personalize the ads you see.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity,</p>
<p>and to promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as</p>
<p>by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies.</p>
<p>We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers,</p>
<p>automated systems, and advanced technology such as encryption and</p>
<p>machine learning. We also offer easy-to-use security tools that add an</p>
<p>extra layer of security to your account. For more information about</p>

<p><strong>How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing On Our Services</strong></p>
<p>People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by</p>
<p>sharing your information in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>People you share and communicate with.</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the</p>
<p>audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on</p>
<p>Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a customized</p>
<p>group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you</p>
<p>send photos to or message. </p>
<p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience,</p>
<p>as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a</p>
<p>Facebook Page or another public forum. Public information is available</p>
<p>to anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through</p>
<p>online search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on TV. </p>
<p>In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download</p>
<p>or re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you</p>
<p>comment on another person’s post or like their content on Facebook,</p>
<p>that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If</p>
<p>their audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>
<p><strong>People that see content others share about you.</strong></p>
<p>Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the</p>
<p>audience they choose. For example, people may share a photo of you,</p>
<p>mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about</p>
<p>you that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s</p>
<p>post, social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for</p>
<p>help from someone they trust. Learn More.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our</strong></p>
<p><strong>Services.</strong></p>
<p>When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or</p>
<p>are integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about</p>
<p>what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your</p>
<p>Facebook friends or use the Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website may get information about your</p>
<p>activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from</p>
<p>their website on Facebook. In addition, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes</p>
<p>your username or user ID, your age range and country/language, your</p>
<p>list of friends, as well as any information that you share with them.</p>
<p>Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is</p>
<p>subject to their own terms and policies. </p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that</p>
<p>you or others share with these apps and websites.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing within Facebook companies.</strong></p>
<p>We share information we have about you within the family of</p>
<p>companies that are part of Facebook. Learn more about our companies.</p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </p>
<p><strong>Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or</p>
<p>who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our</p>
<p>companies and provide free services to people around the world. </p>
<p>Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you:</p>
<p><strong>Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Only).</strong></p>
<p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other</p>
<p>information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of</p>
<p>the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do</p>
<p>not share information that personally identifies you (personally</p>
<p>identifiable information is information like name or email address that</p>
<p>can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with</p>
<p>advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us</p>
<p>permission. We may provide these partners with information about the</p>
<p>reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the</p>
<p>information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we</p>
<p>may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people</p>
<p>viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-</p>
<p>personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old</p>
<p>female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to</p>
<p>help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the</p>
<p>advertiser has agreed to abide by our advertiser guidelines. </p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re</p>
<p>seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences</p>
<p>if you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners.</strong></p>
<p>We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other</p>
<p>partners who globally support our business, such as providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring</p>
<p>the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys.</p>
<p>These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way</p>
<p>that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements we enter into</p>
<p>with them.</p>

<p><strong>information about me?</strong></p>

<p>account instead. To learn more about deactivating or deleting your account, click here.</p>

<p><strong>How do we respond to legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like</p>
<p>a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions</p>
<p>outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is</p>
<p>required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent</p>
<p>with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share</p>
<p>information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and</p>
<p>address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including</p>
<p>as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we</p>
<p>may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to</p>
<p>prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our Services. Information we receive about you,</p>
<p>including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook, may be</p>
<p>accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject</p>
<p>of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may</p>
<p>retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year</p>
<p>to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms.</p>
