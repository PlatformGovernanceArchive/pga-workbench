<p>We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Facebook works. You should read this policy in its entirety, but should</p>
<p>pay particular attention to these three highlights: </p>
<p><strong>Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want. You decide how much</strong></p>
<p><strong>information you feel comfortable sharing on Facebook and you control how it is distributed through your</strong><strong>privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings</strong><strong>. You should review the default</strong><strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences. You</strong></p>
<p><strong>should also consider your settings whenever you share information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is not just a website. It is also a service for sharing your information on Facebook-enhanced applications and</strong></p>
<p><strong>websites. You can control how you share information with those third-party applications and websites through</strong></p>
<p><strong>your</strong><strong>application settings</strong><strong>and you can learn more about how information is shared with them on our</strong><strong>About</strong></p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong><strong>page. You can also limit how your friends share your information with applications through your</strong><strong>privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your information with advertisers</strong></p>
<p><strong>without your consent. We allow advertisers to select characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to</strong></p>
<p><strong>and we use the information we have collected to serve those advertisements.</strong></p>
<p>This policy contains eight sections:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Information You Share With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p>**7. How We Protect Information</span>8.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Principles</strong></p>
<p>We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may</p>
<p>not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you control of your</p>
<p>information.</span> O<span style="background-color: red;">ur defaul</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> privacy settings limit t</span>he<span style="background-color: red;"> info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">T</span><span style="background-color: red;">display</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">d in you</span>r<span style="background-color: red;"> profile to your networks and other</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control the users</p>
<p>with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the Privacy page.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: red;">2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong> </p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your</p>
<p>friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with</p>
<p>whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please check out our privacy help page.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Facebook</p>
<p>visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on</p>
<p>the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.</p>
<p>These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID</p>
<p>(but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Facebook. You can remove or block this</p>
<p>cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and</p>
<p>queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this</p>
<p>information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for</p>
<p>instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information,</p>
<p>we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version</p>
<p>of that information.</p>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Facebook Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set</p>
<p>privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We</p>
<p>cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we</p>
<p>cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are</p>
<p>not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and</p>
<p>acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if</p>
<p>other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Facebook is a violation of the Facebook Terms of Service and</p>
<p>should be reported through the Help Center.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the</p>
<p>invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will send your friend an email or instant message in your name inviting</p>
<p>him or her to visit the site, and may send up to two reminders to them. Facebook stores this information to send</p>
<p>invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you</p>
<p>have sent, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us through the Help Center to request</p>
<p>that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging</p>

<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal information.</strong> When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the</p>
<p>registration process we give you the opportunity to provide additional profile information, such as where you went to school and</p>
<p>where you work, and to add a picture of yourself, to help your friends connect with you. In some cases we may ask for additional</p>
<p>information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can visit your profile at any time to</p>
<p>add or remove personal information about yourself. You can add basic information about yourself, such as information about your</p>
<p>hometown, family, relationships, and your political and religious views. You can also add other information about yourself</p>
<p>including your activities, interests, contact information, as well as more information about your education and job history. </p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong>One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your</p>
<p>status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write</p>
<p>something on someoneʼs Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with</p>
<p>content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content. </p>
<p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong>We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook. However, we will only</p>
<p>keep your payment source account number with your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friendsʼ addresses so that you can find your friends</p>
<p>on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have Facebook accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information,</p>
<p>visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have</p>
<p>uploaded your contactsʼ information.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information.</strong>When you share your location with others or add a location to something you post, we treat that like any</p>
<p>other content you post (for example, it is subject to your privacy settings). If we offer a service that supports this type of location</p>
<p>sharing we will present you with an opt-in choice of whether you want to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding a friend, becoming a fan of a</p>
<p>Facebook Page, joining a group or an event, creating a photo album, sending a gift, poking another user, indicating you “like” a</p>
<p>post, attending an event, or authorizing an application. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information</p>
<p>or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact</p>
<p>you shared it. </p>
<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may</p>
<p>collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong>We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile</p>
<p>phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For</p>
<p>example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back</p>
<p>to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook</p>
<p>Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies</p>
<p>using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook. </p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect.</strong>We do not own or operate the applications that you use through Facebook Platform</p>
<p>(such as games and utilities) or the websites that you interact with through Facebook Connect. We refer to them as “Facebook-</p>
<p>enhanced” applications and websites because they use our Platform to provide you with social features. Whenever you authorize a</p>
<p>Facebook-enhanced application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take.</p>
<p>In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you</p>
<p>authorize the application or website. </p>
<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong>We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share</p>
<p>information with us: </p>
<ul>
<li>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other</li>
</ul>
<p>users who didnʼt see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure</p>
<p>our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may receive information about whether or not youʼve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure</li>
</ul>
<p>the effectiveness of those ads. </p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within</span> 18<span style="background-color: red;">**</span><span style="background-color: green;">0 days, meaning we will stop</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we</p>
<p>explain in the “How </span>We <span style="background-color: green;">U</span><span style="background-color: red;">recommend that minor</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">e</span> <span style="background-color: red;">1</span><span style="background-color: green;">Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you</p>

<p><strong>“Everyone” Privacy Setting.</strong> Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, may be accessed by everyone on the</p>
<p>Internet (including people not logged into</span> Faceboo<span style="background-color: red;">k users may be able to supplement your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the</p>
<p>networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).</p>
<p>Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network</p>
<p>and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your</p>
<p>friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access</p>
<p>your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that</p>
<p>allows such access based on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For</p>
<p>instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an email alerting</p>
<p>you to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, you may opt out of such emails from the Notifications page, though Facebook reserves the right to send you</p>
<p>notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for</p>
<p>purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and</p>
<p>promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around</p>
<p>you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite</p>
<p>movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we</p>
<p>don't tell the movie company who you are.</p>
<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet</p>
<p>sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers and other users of Facebook, to</p>
<p>supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you</p>
<p>do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g.,</p>
<p>removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with</p>
<p>privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information you</p>
<p>provide to friends and networks through Facebook. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make</p>
<p>informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not provide contact information to third party</p>
<p>marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we</p>
<p>believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>Your News Feed and Wall may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and</p>
<p>network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your News Feed and Wall on</p>
<p>your Privacy Settings page.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine "crawlers"</p>
<p>(e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal information</p>
<p>beyond your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use</p>
<p>third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out</p>
<p>email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for</p>
<p>products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including</p>
<p>sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access</p>
<p>to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize</p>
<p>third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical</p>
<p>protections limiting the use of that information to the Facebook-specified purposes.</p>
<p>If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using the Facebook</p>
<p>Platform ("Platform Applications"), those Platform Applications may access and share certain information about you</p>
<p>with others in accordance with your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information</p>
<p>through Platform Applications on the Privacy Settings page. In addition, third party developers who have created</p>
<p>and operate Platform Applications ("Platform Developers"), may also have access to your personal information</p>
<p>(excluding your contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any</p>
<p>Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Facebook requires the Platform Developer to</p>
<p>enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly</p>
<p>limits their collection, use, and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and</p>
<p>technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we of course cannot</p>
<p>and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that Facebook does</p>
<p>not screen or approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal</p>
<p>information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform Developers may</p>
<p>require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them</p>
<p>additional rights or impose additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms and policies</p>
<p>carefully before using any Platform Application. You can report any suspected misuse of information through the</p>
<p>Facebook Platform and we will investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Platform</p>
<p>Developer up to and including terminating their participation in the Facebook Platform and/or other formal legal</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such</p>
<p>accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit</p>
<p>possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or</p>
<p>in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an</p>
<p>information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may</p>
<p>share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or</p>
<p>property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook</p>
<p>name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers,</p>
<p>agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another</p>
<p>company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with</p>
<p>that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a</p>
<p>purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear</p>
<p>disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on</p>
<p>Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on</p>
<p>that site. You have the choice to have Facebook discard that information, or to share it with your friends.</p>
<p>To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the</p>
<p>service altogether, click here.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are</p>
<p>logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the</p>
<p>technical operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives information on users that are not logged in, or</p>
<p>on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can</p>
<p>continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the</p>
<p>promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your</p>
<p>networ</span>k), <span style="background-color: red;">such as personal </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">nforma</span><span style="background-color: green;">s subjec</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;"> t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;"> i</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">dexing by third party search engines</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">co</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">ay b</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nt</span><span style="background-color: green;"> a</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">sociated with</p>

<p>without privacy limitations. The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.”</p>
<p>You can review and change the default settings in your privacy settings. If you delete “everyone” content that you posted on</p>

<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on</p>
<p>how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve</p>
<p>those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal</p>
<p>activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. For example, we ask for your date of birth to verify that you</p>
<p>are over age 13 and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. We also</p>
<p>use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as</p>
<p>spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all</p>
<p>communications except essential updates on your account notifications page. We may include content you see on Facebook in the</p>
<p>emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We donʼt share your information with advertisers without your consent.</span> (<span style="background-color: red;">or</span><span style="background-color: green;">An</span> <span style="background-color: red;">"s</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rv</span><span style="background-color: green;">xampl</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>advertiser<span style="background-color: green;">s to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally</p>
<p>identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your</p>
<p>birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisement</span>s.<span style="background-color: green;"> For</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment</p>
<p>company who you are. You can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not</p>
<p>share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there</p>
<p>is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected. </p>
<p><strong></span>T<span style="background-color: red;">hey aut</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">matically</span> <span style="background-color: red;">r</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ceive you</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ve social ads.</strong>We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends</p>
<p>to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends. For example, if you become a fan of a Page,</p>
<p>we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that Page that is displayed to your friends. We only share</p>
<p>the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your</p>
<p>information used in social ads on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your</p>
<p>profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update).</span> I<span style="background-color: red;">P address whe</span>n <span style="background-color: red;">thi</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to</p>
<p>yo</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">r </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">omputer, or use ot</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">er</span> <span style="background-color: red;">te</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">hnologies such </span>as<span style="background-color: red;"> JavaScript and "w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">b beacon</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">"</span><span style="background-color: green;"> we generally allow you to direct</p>

In this way, they may compile information a</span>b<span style="background-color: red;">out where </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ndividua</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">s us</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ng your compu</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">er or</p>
<p>browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access to or</p>
<p>control of the cookies that ma</span>y <span style="background-color: red;">be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have n</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> access to your</p>
<p>co</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">tact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking</p>
<p>technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.</p>
<p>Facebook users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information</p>
<p>will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the My</p>
<p>Account page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally</p>
<p>available to members of</span> Facebook.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>To make Suggestions.</strong> </span>W<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">re</span> <span style="background-color: red;">yo</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">se your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers, and other</p>
<p>relevant information, to help you connect with your friends, including</span> mak<span style="background-color: red;">e use of the commun</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">catio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g</span> <span style="background-color: red;">feature</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> of the service to share information with other individ</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">ggestions to you </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">nd other users that you connect</p>
<p>with on Facebook. If you want to </span>l<span style="background-color: green;">imit your visibility in suggestions we make to other people, you can adjust your search</p>
<p>visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the extent you choose to be visible in public search</p>
<p>listings. You may also block specific individual users from being suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and</p>
<p>photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the</p>
<p>information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If</p>
<p>we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you</p>
<p>provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the userʼs account. In such cases we</p>
<p>restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to write on the userʼs Wall in remembrance. We may close</p>
<p>an account if we receive a formal request from the userʼs next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p>
<p><strong>5. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with privacy</p>
<p>settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information with third parties</p>
<p>when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><strong>When you make a payment.</strong> When you enter into transactions with others or make payment</span>s on Facebook,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>ho</span>we<span style="background-color: red;">ve</span><span style="background-color: green;"> will only sha</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e</p>
<p>transaction information with those third parties necessary to complete the transaction and will require those third parties to agree</p>
<p>to respect the privacy of your information. </p>
<p><strong>When you invite a friend to join.</strong> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">we will send your friend a message on your</p>
<p>behalf using your name. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If your friend does not want us to keep</p>
<p>their information, we will remove it at their request on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</strong> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic</p>
<p>commerce providers that are not associated with Facebook through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will</p>
<p>not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results</p>
<p>on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can control who has access to this information, as well as who can find</p>
<p>you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users</p>
<p>identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote Facebook to those users. </p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search enginesʼ access to our site. We may</p>
<p>allow them to access information set to the “everyone” setting and your public search listing </span>(<span style="background-color: green;">but you can turn off your public</p>
<p>s</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">arch listing in your privacy settings)</span>.<span style="background-color: red;">g</span><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"></strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or</p>
<p>promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For</p>
<p>example</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nding</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a personal </span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ess</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">ge</span> <span style="background-color: green;">us</span><span style="background-color: red;">to anoth</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> thi</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">d parties to help host our website, send out email updates about</span> Facebook<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">use</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">emove repetitive</p>
<p>information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links</span>)<span style="background-color: red;"> you generally cannot remove such communications</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> These service</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable</p>
<p>contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them</p>
<p>to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook</p>
<p>Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the</p>
<p>partner and present the joint service providerʼs privacy policy to you before you use that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other</p>
<p>requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include</p>
<p>respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United </span>S<span style="background-color: red;">ecuri</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">y**</span><span style="background-color: green;">ates where we have a good faith belief that the response is required</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted</p>
<p>international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other</p>
<p>illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and</p>
<p>Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>

<p>mea</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">s of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a purchase or post a review, with your</p>
<p>friends on Facebook</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on</p>
<p>third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it</p>
<p>to you after you have completed an action on that site. </span>You<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: red;">account information is located on a secured</p>
<p>server be</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ind </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">v</span><span style="background-color: red;"> fir</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">w</span><span style="background-color: green;"> the choice to h</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ll</span><span style="background-color: green;">ve us discard that information, or to share it with</p>
<p>your friends</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the</p>
<p>service altogether, click here. Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even</p>
<p>if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical</p>
<p>operation of the system. In cases where we receive information from Beacon sites on users that are not logged in, or on non-</p>
<p>Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may</p>
<p>transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would</p>
<p>remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Viewing and editing your profile.</strong> You may change or delete your profile information at any time by going to your profile page</p>
<p>and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately. </span>Wh<span style="background-color: red;">en you enter sens</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">le you canno</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> delete your date of b</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">rth, you can use the</p>
<p>setting on the info tab of your profile information page to hide all or part of it from other users.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Deacti</span>v<span style="background-color: green;">ating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you</p>
<p>deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profil</span>e information (<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;">such as c</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">t card numb</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">r or your passwor</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">s, photos,</p>
<p>interests, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and</p>
<p>in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate</p>
<p>your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete</p>
<p>your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account settings page or</p>
<p>delete your account on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information</p>
<p>may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy</p>
<p>settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on</p>
<p>Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another userʼs profile, and then you delete your account, that post may remain,</p>
<p>but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”) Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and</p>
<p>other misconduct even if deletion has been requested.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to</p>
<p>others. </p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to</p>
<p>delete your address, you can do so on this help page. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the</p>
<p>request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later. </p>
<p><strong>7. How We Protect Information</strong></p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on</p>
<p>Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When</p>
<p>you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords</span>), we encrypt<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that information using secure socket<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>layer technology (SSL). <span style="background-color: red;">(</span><span style="background-color: green;">We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for</p>
<p>fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove</p>
<p>inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights</p>
<p>and Responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please</p>
<p>be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share</p>
<p>your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information</p>
<p>you share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy</p>
<p>settings or security measures on Facebook. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as</p>
<p>choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software. </p>
<p><strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on this help page. </p>
