Security

 

Thefacebook accounts are password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to protect our users'

information. Passwords are stored in hashed form in our database, and different sections of users' profiles are

stored in different parts of our database to separate access to all of the information and make it more difficult to

piece everything together. If you have any questions about the security of our web site, please contact us. 

 

Changes in Our Privacy Policy

 

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on our web

site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if

any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that

stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email.
