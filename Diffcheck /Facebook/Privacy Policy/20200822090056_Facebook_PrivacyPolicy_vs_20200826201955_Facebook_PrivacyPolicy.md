our social plugins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel. These partners

provide information about your activities off Facebook – including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases

you make, the ads you see and how you use their services – whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in to

Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a

purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party

data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties that they work with. We require each of

these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing us with any data. Learn more about the

**Information across Facebook Products and devices:** We connect information about your activities on different

Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products that you

use, wherever you use them. For example, we can su</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">gest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you

follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for

example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product

when you sign up for an account on a different Product.

you will have control over whether we use this technology for you.

interests, actions and connections – to select and personalise ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you.

Learn more about how we select and personalise ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other

sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

**Provide measurement, analytics and other business services.**

We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help

advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of

people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps and services. Learn how we share information

with these partners.

**Promote safety, integrity and security.**

We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other

bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Facebook Products. For

example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when

someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Centre and Instagram Security Tips.

**Communicate with you.**

We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let

you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.

**Research and innovate for social good.**

We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and

innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. For example,

we analyse information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research

programmes.

**Content that others share or reshare about you.**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to

share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For

example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare

that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,

when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see

the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people

can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or

messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the

content.

**Information about your active status or presence on our Products.**

People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently

active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.

**Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products.**

receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a

Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities

in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such

Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves)</span>.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>

<span style="background-color: green;">Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our

own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share

with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.

*Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will*

*remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are*

*changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only*

*name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.*

<span style="background-color: green;">We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their

posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram

business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their

posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or

account.

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't

share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to

contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and

interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in

Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led

you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

**Measurement partners.**

We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.

Information across Facebook Products and devices:

Information across Facebook Products and devices: We

connect information about your activities on different Facebook

Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent

experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use

them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on

Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or

communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your

experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in

your registration information (such as your phone number) from

your registration information (such as your phone number) from

one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a

different Product.

Location-related information:

Location-related information: We use location-related

information-such as your current location, where you live, the

places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-

to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads,

for you and others. Location-related information can be based on

things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect

it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of

Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).

Product research and development:

Product research and development: We use the

information we have to develop, test and improve our Products,

including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and

troubleshooting new products and features.

Face recognition:

Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face

recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and

camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create

may constitute data with special protections under the laws of

your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition

technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook

Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your

Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have

control over whether we use this technology for you.

Ads and other sponsored content:

Ads and other sponsored content: We use the information

we have about you-including information about your interests,

actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and

other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about

how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the

data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in

the Facebook Settings and Instagram Setting</span>s.

How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the

audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,

you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,

the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use

Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses,

those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network

can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including

engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts

see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. 

Public information

Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,

including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram

username; any information you share with a public audience; information

in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook

Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as

Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,

and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or

off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in

search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be

seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services

such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps,

websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 

Learn more about what information is public and how to control your

visibility on Facebook and Instagram.

**Content others share or reshare about you**

**Content others share or reshare about you**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who

can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others

on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the

audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a

message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,

or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or

in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you

comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your

comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's

content, and that person can change the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you

with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of

you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share

information about you in their posts or messages. If you are

uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products,

you can learn how to report the content.

Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and

Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you use. We also

process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with

their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take

appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact

with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.

**V. How can I manage or delete information about me?**

We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Facebook settings and Instagram settings.

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products or until your account is deleted – whichever

comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed,

and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete

that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your

government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more

about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.

When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to

recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want

to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at

any time, please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings.

**VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?**

We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:

In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to

do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief

that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised

standards.

When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products,

breaches of our Terms or Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products),

you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if

relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent

fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.

Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and

preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of

possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term

breaches for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches.

**VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?**

We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect

and share with around the world in accordance with this Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored

and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data

transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms, and to globally operate and provide

our Products to you. We utilise standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,

as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.

**VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?**

We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to

continue using our Products.</span>

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our**

**Products.**

**Products.**

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that

use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information

about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with

your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a

website, the game developer or website can receive information about

your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share

from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such

third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and

any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use

may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with

them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other

information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about

any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers

may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).

Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own

terms and policies, not this one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and

Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)

will have access to all information you choose to share with them,

including information your friends share with you, so they can provide

our core functionality to you. 

Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even

further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'

access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app

in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we

will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to

include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email

address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.

**New owner.**

**New owner.**

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets

changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who

use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to

operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't

sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict

restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the

types of third parties we share information with: 

**Partners who use our analytics services.**

**Partners who use our analytics services.**

We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and

businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,

Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For

example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive

information about the number of people or accounts who viewed,

reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate

demographic and other information that helps them understand

demographic and other information that helps them understand

interactions with their Page or account.

**Advertisers.**

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing

their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share

information that personally identifies you (information such as your

name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or

identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we

provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for

example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34

who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better

understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you

to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

**Measurement partners.**

**Measurement partners.**

We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to

provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.

**Partners offering goods and services in our Products.**

**Partners offering goods and services in our Products.**

When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from

a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your

public information and other information you share with them, as well as

the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping

and contact details.

**Vendors and service providers.**

**Vendors and service providers.**

We provide information and content to vendors and service providers

who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure

services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer

service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.

**Researchers and academics.**

**Researchers and academics.**

We also provide information and content to research partners and

academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation

that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and

innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological

advancement, public interest, health and well-being.

**Law enforcement or legal requests.**

**Law enforcement or legal requests.**

We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal

requests in the circumstances outlined below.
