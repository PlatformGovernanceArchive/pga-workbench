innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company

Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook

about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action

against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to

We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn

more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. 

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook

Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-

case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is

collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For

example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete

that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is

deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for<span style="background-color: red;">

When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your

photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later.

Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't<span style="background-color: red;">
