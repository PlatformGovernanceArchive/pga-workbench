<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our</p>
<p>social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel. These partners provide</p>
<p>information about your activities off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you</p>
<p>make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a</p>
<p>purchase you made in its store. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party</p>
<p>data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require each of these</p>
<p>partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us. Learn more about the types of</p>
<p>partners we receive data from.</p>

<p>Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be</p>
<p>interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and</p>
<p>relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you</p>
<p>and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and</p>

<p>information about you to personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features, content and</p>
<p>recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on different</p>
<p>Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use,</p>
<p>wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow</p>
<p>on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by</p>
<p>automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you</p>
<p>sign up for an account on a different Product.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lo<span style="background-color: red;">g I</span><span style="background-color: green;">catio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">-related information:</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"> We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products,</p>

<p>you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of </span>F<span style="background-color: red;">orgotten </span>ac<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">eb</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ok Prod</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">c</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">s (such as</p>

<p>including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and</p>
<p>camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special protections under the</p>
<p>laws of your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in</p>
<p>Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and</p>
<p>you will have control over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information about your</p>
<p>interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you.</p>
<p>Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other</p>
<p>sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help</p>
<p>advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of</p>
<p>people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share information</p>
<p>with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad</p>
<p>experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and let you</p>
<p>know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. For example,</p>
<p>we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programs.</p>

<p>people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and</p>
<p>businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your</p>
<p>Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on Facebook; and</p>
<p>content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<p>You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off</p>
<p>our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information</p>
<p>can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline</p>
<p>media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to</p>
<p>share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For</p>
<p>example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare</p>
<p>that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see</p>
<p>the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people</p>
<p>can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or</p>

<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products</span>.</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>People</span> <span style="background-color: green;">in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently</p>
<p>active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can</p>
<p>receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a</p>
<p>Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities</p>
<p>in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and</p>
<p>websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use</p>
<p>will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your</p>
<p>Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our</p>
<p>own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share</p>
<p>with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will</em></p>
<p><em>remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are</em></p>
<p><em>changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new</p>
<p>owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow</p>
<p>their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We</p>
<p>don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their</p>
<p>posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram</p>
<p>business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their</p>
<p>posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to</p>
<p>contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and</p>
<p>interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led</p>
<p>you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can</p>
<p>receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the</p>
<p>transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting</p>
<p>surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship</p>
<p>and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare,</p>
<p>technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>

<p><strong>I<span style="background-color: green;">V</span><span style="background-color: red;">nformation from partners</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> How do the Facebook Companies work together?</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and</p>
<p>Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use. We also</p>
<p>process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with</p>
<p>their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take</p>
<p>appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact</p>
<p>with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever</p>
<p>comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and</p>
<p>relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that</p>
<p>query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your</p>
<p>government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content</p>
<p>you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover</p>
<p>that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete</p>
<p>your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time,</p>
<p>please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to</p>
<p>do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of</p>
<p>our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others,</p>
<p>including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we</p>
<p>provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and</p>
<p>other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and</p>
<p>preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms</p>
<p>violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect</p>
<p>and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored</p>
<p>and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data</p>
<p>transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide</p>
<p>our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to</p>
<p>continue using our Products.</span></p>

<p>purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your</p>
<p>online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers</p>

<p>can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts</p>
<p>see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p>Public information</p>
<p>Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,</p>
<p>including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram</p>
<p>username, any information you share with a public audience, information</p>
<p>in your public profile on Facebook, and content you share on a Facebook</p>
<p>Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as</p>
<p>Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,</p>
<p>and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or</p>
<p>off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in</p>
<p>search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be</p>
<p>seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services</p>
<p>such as search engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps,</p>
<p>websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>

<p><strong>Content that others share or reshare about you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content that others share or reshare about you.</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>
<p>can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others</p>
<p>on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a post or</p>
<p>send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download,</p>
<p>screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products,</p>
<p>in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content,</p>
<p>your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other</p>
<p>your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other</p>
<p>person's content, and that person can change the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you</p>
<p>with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of</p>
<p>you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are</p>
<p>uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products,</p>
<p>you can learn how to report the content.</p>

<p><strong>Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you</p>
<p>use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it</p>
<p>with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive</p>
<p>any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or</p>
<p>information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends</p>
<p>and followers may, of course, choose to share this information</p>
<p>themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is</p>
<p>subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information that you choose to share with them,</p>
<p>including information that your friends share with you, so they can</p>
<p>provide our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version,</p>
<p>we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>
<p>address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</p>

<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with third-party partners</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing with third-party partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't</p>
<p>sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the</p>
<p>types of third parties that we share information with: </p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and</p>
<p>businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,</p>
<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>
<p>information about the number of people or accounts who viewed,</p>
<p>reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate</p>
<p>demographic and other information that helps them understand</p>
<p>interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing</p>
<p>their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you (information such as your</p>
<p>name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or</p>
<p>identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34</p>
<p>who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you</p>
<p>to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from</p>
<p>a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your</p>
<p>public information and other information that you share with them, as</p>
<p>well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including</p>
<p>shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers</p>
<p>who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure</p>
<p>services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer</p>
<p>service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and</p>
<p>academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation</p>
<p>that supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological</p>
<p>advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>

<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you</p>
<p>use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on</p>
<p>its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>How can I manage or delete information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook settings and Instagram settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected</p>
<p>and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your valid photo ID for account verification purposes, we delete that</p>
<p>copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content that you have</p>
<p>shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your</p>
<p>photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover this information later.</p>
<p>Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be</p>
<p>deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the</p>
<p>Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time,</p>
<p>please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>

<p>How do we respond to legal requests or</p>
<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognised standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and</p>
<p>address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or</p>
<p>Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our</p>
<p>rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or</p>
<p>regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if</p>
<p>relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other</p>
<p>harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to</p>
<p>purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period</p>
<p>when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or</p>
<p>investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent</p>
<p>harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term breaches for at least a</p>
<p>year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches.</p>

<p>How do we operate and transfer data as</p>
<p>part of our global services?</p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world</p>
<p>in accordance with this Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms,</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilise standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>

<p>How will we notify you of changes to this</p>
<p>Policy?</p>
