<p><strong>Facebook’s Privacy Policy<span style="background-color: red;"></strong></p>
<p>Date of last revision: December 9, 2009.</p>
<p>We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Facebook works. You should read this policy in its entirety, but should pay particular attention to these four highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want. You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing on</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook and you control how it is distributed through your</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>. You should review the default</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong> <strong>and change them if necessary to</strong></p>
<p><strong>reflect your preferences. You should also consider your settings whenever you share information</span>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">D</span><span style="background-color: red;"> </p>
<p><strong>F</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">cebook is no</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> just a w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">b</span><span style="background-color: green;"> of la</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">i</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> r</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">vision: April 22, 2010</span>.<span style="background-color: red;"> It is also a service for sharing your information on Facebook-enhanced applications and websites. You can control how you share</strong></p>
<p><strong>information with those third-party applications and websites through your</strong> <strong>application settings</strong> <strong>and you can learn more about how information is shared with them</strong></p>
<p><strong>on our</strong> <strong>About Platform</strong> <strong>page. You can also limit how your friends share your information with applications through your</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Certain categories of information such as your name, profile photo, list of friends and pages you are a fan of, gender, geographic region, and networks you belong</strong></p>
<p><strong>to are considered publicly available to everyone, including Facebook-enhanced applications, and therefore do not have</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>. You can, however, limit</strong></p>
<p><strong>the ability of others to find this information through search using your search</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to</strong></p>
<p><strong>select characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to and we use the information we have collected to serve those advertisements.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Scope.</strong> This privacy policy covers all of Facebook. It does not, however, apply to entities that Facebook does not own or control, such as <span style="background-color: red;">F</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">cebook-enhanced a</span>pplications and websites<span style="background-color: green;"> using Platform</span>.

<p>that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under</p>

You can also add other information about yourself</p>
<p>including your activities, interests, contact information, as well as more information about your education and job history</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong> One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video,</p>
<p>share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with</p>
<p>content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.</p>

<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can find your friends on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have</p>
<p>Facebook accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you</p>

<p><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you share your location with others or add a location to something you post, we treat that like any other content you post (for example, it is subject to your</p>
<p>privacy settings). If we offer a service that supports this type of location sharing we will present you with an opt-in choice of whether you want to participate</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of <span style="background-color: green;">some of </span>the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding <span style="background-color: green;">co</span><span style="background-color: red;">a frie</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">nections (inclu</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">ing joining a group or adding a friend)</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">be</span>c<span style="background-color: green;">re</span><span style="background-color: red;">oming </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ti</span><span style="background-color: red;"> fa</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of </span>a<span style="background-color: green;"> photo album,</p>

<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type,</p>
<p>location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make</p>
<p>our advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come</p>
<p>back to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share</p>
<p>buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform<span style="background-color: red;"> and Facebook Connect</span>.</strong> We do not own or operate the applications <span style="background-color: green;">or websites </span>that you use through Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities)<span style="background-color: green;">.</span> <span style="background-color: green;">W</span><span style="background-color: red;">or t</span>he<span style="background-color: red;"> websites that you</p>

We </span>r<span style="background-color: red;">efer to them as “Facebook-enhanced” applications and websites because they use our Platform to provide you with social features. Whenever you</p>

<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">-</span> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data</p>
<p>sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">- </span>We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.</p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we</p>
<p>institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you in a photo<span style="background-color: red;"> or video</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">pro</span>vide<span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">s friend details</span>, or <span style="background-color: red;">indicates a</p>

<p><strong>3. <span style="background-color: red;">Information You Share With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that others use information that you share on Facebook in a manner consistent with your privacy settings, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules. Read</p>
<p>the following section to learn more about how you can protect yourself when you share information with third parties.</p>
<p><strong></span>Sharing information on Facebook.</strong> <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p>T</span><span style="background-color: red;">We designed our privacy settings to enable you to control </span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ow you share your </span>i<span style="background-color: green;">s sec</span><span style="background-color: red;">nforma</span>tion<span style="background-color: green;"> explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared</span> on Facebook. You should <span style="background-color: red;">review the def</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">u</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">t priv</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">c</span>y<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">ettings</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">c</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>m</span><span style="background-color: green;">nsider your priv</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">cy settings before sharing information on Faceboo</span>k<span style="background-color: red;">e sure they reflect your preferences</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong>Name and Profile Picture.</strong> Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have privacy settings. If you</p>
<p>are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one). You can also control who can find you when searching on Facebook or on public search engines using</p>
<p>your search settings.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> Your contact information settings control who can contact you on Facebook, and who can see your contact information such as your email and phone number(s). </p>
<p>Remember that none of this information is required except for your email address, and you do not have to share your email address with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Your personal information settings control who can see your personal information, such as your religious and political views, if you choose to add them. We recommend</p>
<p>that you share this information using the friends of friends setting.</p>
<p><strong>Posts by Me.</strong> You can select a privacy setting for every post you make using the publisher on our site. Whether you are uploading a photo or posting a status update, you can control exactly</p>
<p>who can see it at the time you create it. Whenever you share something look for the lock icon. Clicking on the lock will bring up a menu that lets you choose who will be able to see your post. If</p>
<p>you decide not to select your setting at the time you post the content, your content will be shared consistent with your Posts by Me privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong>Connections.</strong> Facebook enables you to connect with virtually anyone or anything you want, from your friends and family to the city you live in to the restaurants you like to visit to the bands</p>
<p>and movies you love. Because it takes two to connect, your privacy settings only control who can see the connection on your profile page. If you are uncomfortable with the connection being</p>
<p>publicly available, you should consider removing (or not making) the connection.</p>
<p><strong>Gender and Birth Date.</strong> In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the registration process. We ask for your date of birth to verify</p>
<p>that you are 13 or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot</p>
<p>delete them. You can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such fields from other users.</p>
<p><strong>Other.</strong></span> Here are some <span style="background-color: red;">sp</span><span style="background-color: green;">oth</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;">cific</span> things to remember:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">-</span><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>
<p>Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friends’ home pages and other pages they visit.</p>
<p>If another user tags you in a photo or video or at a place, you can remove the tag.</span> You can <span style="background-color: red;">control the visibility of most of the inform</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">tion you share on Facebook through the privacy settings you se</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">ec</span><span style="background-color: green;">so limi</span>t<span style="background-color: green;"> who can see that you have been tagged on your profile from your privacy settings</span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">-</span><span style="background-color: green;">Even</span> <span style="background-color: green;">after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was</p>
<p>otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.</p>

<p><strong>Minors.</strong> We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the ability of adults to share and</p>

<p><strong>4. Information You Share With Third Parties.</strong></span></p>

<p></span>you are making your Facebook information available to someone other than Facebook. <span style="background-color: green;">Prior to allowing them to access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their</p>
<p>use of your information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized</p>
<p>information. </span>To <span style="background-color: red;">he</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">p thos</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">pplications and sites ope</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">at</span><span style="background-color: green;">n mor</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> about Platform</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">they recei</span>v<span style="background-color: red;">e publ</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">cly available information</p>

<p><strong>Connecting with an Application or Website.</strong> When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you. The term General Information includes</p>
<p>your and your friends’ names</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">and additional info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mati</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n when you </span>f<span style="background-color: red;">ormally author</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">z</span><span style="background-color: green;">l</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">pi</span><span style="background-color: red;">or </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">onnec</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> yo</span>ur<span style="background-color: green;">es, gender, user IDs, connections, and any content shared using the Everyone privacy setting. We may also make information about the location of</p>
<p>your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate</p>
<p>content. If the application or website wants to access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.</p>
<p>We give you tools to control how your information is shared with applications and websites that use Platform.</span> F<span style="background-color: red;">aceb</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">r example, y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u can bloc</span>k <span style="background-color: red;">account with them. You can learn more detail</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> about which information the</p>
<p>o</span>pe<span style="background-color: red;">rators of those appli</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">at</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ons and websites can access on our About Plat</span>f<span style="background-color: red;">orm page. Pr</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">or to allowing them to a</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">cess</span> a<span style="background-color: red;">ny information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their</p>
<p>use of your information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Res</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">onsibilities) and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized</p>
<p>information. We also give you tools to control how your information is shared with them:</p>
<p>[You can choose to o</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">t-out of Facebook P</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">atform and Facebook Connect altogether through your pr</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">va</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">y settings] (We will remove this sentence in the next revision to our Priv</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">cy Policy as </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">he</p>
<p>product has changed)</p>
<ul>
<li>You can block spec</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">fic applicati</span>ons from accessing your information by<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></li>
</ul>
<p></span>visiting your application settings or the application’s “About” page<span style="background-color: green;">. You can also use your privacy settings to limit which of your information is available to “everyone”.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not</p>
<p>guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this help page and we will take action as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>When your friends use Platform.</strong> If your friend connects with an application or website, it will be able to access your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, and information you have shared</p>
<p>with “everyone.” It will also be able to access your connections, except it will not be able to access your friend list. If you have already connected with (or have a separate account with) that</p>
<p>website or application, it may also be able to connect you with your friend on that application or website. If the application or website wants to access any of your other content or information</p>
<p>(including your friend list), it will have to obtain specific permission from your friend. If your friend grants specific permission to the application or website, it will generally only be able to access</p>
<p>content and information about you that your friend can access. In addition, it will only be allowed to use that content and information in connection with that friend. For example, if a friend gives</p>
<p>an application access to a photo you only shared with your friends, that application could allow your friend to view or print the photo, but it cannot show that photo to anyone else.</p>
<p>We provide you with a number of tools to control how your information is shared when your friend connects with an application or website. For example, you can use your application privacy</p>
<p>settings to limit some of the information your friends can make available to applications and websites. You can also block particular applications or websites from accessing your information. You</p>
<p>can use your privacy settings to limit which friends can access your information, or limit which of your information is available to “everyone.” You can also disconnect from a friend if you are</p>
<p>uncomfortable with how they are using your information.</p>
<p><strong>Pre</span>-<span style="background-color: green;">Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications.</strong> In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to provide General Information about</p>
<p>you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-</p>
<p>approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In</p>
<p>these cases we require these websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these</p>
<p>agreements include provisions relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered.</span> You can <span style="background-color: red;">use your priv</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">cy settings to </span>l<span style="background-color: red;">imit which of your information i</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> available t</span>o <span style="background-color: red;">“eve</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">yon</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">mov</span><span style="background-color: red;">” (by d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ul</span><span style="background-color: green;">ny pre-</p>

<p><strong>Exporting Information.</strong> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book<span style="background-color: green;"> application</span>s, or copy and paste functions, to capture<span style="background-color: green;">,</p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: red;"> and </span>export<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;"> (and in some cases, import) </span>information from Facebook, including your information and information about you<span style="background-color: green;">. For example, if you share your phone number with your friends, they may</p>
<p>use third party applications to sync that information with the address book on their mobile phone</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may</p>
<p>opt-out of the placement of cookies by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks.</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements<span style="background-color: red;">.</p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer</p>
<p>support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. For example, we ask for your date of birth to verify that you</p>
<p>are over age 13 and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address</p>
<p>anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some</p>
<p>users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates on your account notifications page.</p>
<p>We may include content you see on Facebook in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you asked us to provide your shipping</p>
<p>address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally</p>
<p>identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to</p>
<p>select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment</p>
<p>company who you are. You can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when</p>
<p>you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.</p>
<p><strong>To serve social ads.</strong> We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to</p>
<p>you and your friends. For example, if you become a fan of a Page, we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that Page that is displayed to your friends. We only</p>
<p>share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in</p>
<p>a status update). In such cases we generally allow you to direct how that information is shared in your privacy settings or give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to</p>
<p>remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>To make Suggestions.</strong> We use your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers, and other relevant information, to help you connect with your friends,</p>
<p>including making suggestions to you and other users that you connect with on Facebook. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other people, you can adjust your search</p>
<p>visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the extent you choose to be visible in public search listings. You may also block specific individual users from being</p>
<p>suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a</p>
<p>formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If</p>
<p>we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you</p>
<p>want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and</p>
<p>family to write on the user’s Wall in remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Beacon.</strong> [We have announced a settlement of a lawsuit related to the Beacon product: the Beacon product will be discontinued and this language removed from the privacy policy</p>
<p>upon approval of a settlement by the court.] Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a purchase or post a review, with your</p>
<p>friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on</p>
<p>Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on that site. You have the choice to have us discard that information, or to share</p>
<p>it with your friends. To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the service altogether, click here. Like many other websites that</p>
<p>interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the</p>
<p>technical operation of the system. In cases where we receive information from Beacon sites on users that are not logged in, or on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with</p>
<p>individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>

<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can</p>
<p>control who can see some of this information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users</p>
<p>identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote Facebook to those users.</p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search engines’ access to our site. We may allow them to access information set to the “everyone”</p>
<p>setting (along with your name and profile picture) and your profile information that is visible to everyone. You can change the visibility of some of your profile information using your privacy</p>
<p>settings. You can also prevent search engines from indexing your profile using your search settings.</p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service.</strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no</p>
<p>individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website,</p>
<p>send out email updates about Facebook, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers</p>
<p>may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to</p>
<p>helping us provide the service.</p>
<p><strong>To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in</p>
<p>doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your</p>
<p>information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you use that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good</p>
<p>faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is</p>
<p>required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information</p>
<p>when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of</p>
<p>Rights and Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the</p>
<p>service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>7. How You Can Change or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing your profile.</strong> You may change or remov</span>e your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>immediately.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">Wh</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">le you cannot delete your date of birth, you can use the setting on the info tab of your profile infor</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ation page to hide all or part of it fro</span>m<span style="background-color: red;"> oth</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r us</span><span style="background-color: green;">diat</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rs</span><span style="background-color: green;">ly</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page.<span style="background-color: green;"> You can delete the email addresses of friends you have invited</p>
<p>to join Facebook on your invite history page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Deactivating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will</p>
<p>not be deleted. We save your profile information (<span style="background-color: green;">co</span><span style="background-color: red;">frie</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">nection</span>s, photo<span style="background-color: red;">s, interest</span>s, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and</p>
<p></span>in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>delete</span> <span style="background-color: green;">delete</p>
<p></span>an account, it is permanently deleted<span style="background-color: green;"> from Facebook</span>. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account<span style="background-color: red;"> settings</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">settings </span>page or delete your account on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been</p>
<p>shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information</p>
<p>on Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another user’s profile<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p>Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested<span style="background-color: green;">. If you have given third party applications or websites access to</p>
<p>your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through our</p>
<p>Platform after you disconnect from them</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to delete your address, you can do so on this help page.</p>
<p>However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">7</span><span style="background-color: green;">8</span>. How We Protect Information</strong> </p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card</p>
<p>numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account</p>
<p>behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and</p>
<p>may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or</p>
<p>impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot</p>
<p>ensure that information you share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Facebook.</p>
<p>You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus</p>
<p>software.</p>
<p><strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on this help page.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">8</span><span style="background-color: green;">9</span>. Other Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes<span style="background-color: green;">.</span></strong><span style="background-color: red;">.</span> We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Facebook Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy</p>
<p>applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here and on the Facebook Site Governance Page.</p>
<p>You can make sure that you receive notice directly by becoming a fan of the Facebook Site Governance Page.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States.</strong> By using Facebook, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Defined Terms.</strong> "Us," "we," "our," "Platform" and "Facebook" mean the same as they do in the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. “Information” and “content” are used more generally and</p>
<p>interchangeably here than in the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities unless otherwise limited by the context.</p>
