**2. Information We Receive**


**Information you provide to us:**


**Information About Yourself.** When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the registration process<span style="background-color: red;">


we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">giv</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">g</span><span style="background-color: red;">you the opportun</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ty</span><span style="background-color: green;">ve</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span> <span style="background-color: green;">the opportunity to


</span>connect with your friends, schools, and employers. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask<span style="background-color: red;">


Email

Keep</span> <span style="background-color: red;">me logged in


Forgot your password?



</span>for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>connecting with, for example, your current city, hometown, family, relationships, networks, activities,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>interests, and places. You can also provide personal<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information about yourself, such as your political and religious views.


**Content.** One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your status, upload or take a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>photo, upload or record a video,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>before uploading the content.


**Transactional Information.** We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook. If you do not want us to store your payment<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>source account number, you can<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>remove it using your payments page. 


**Friend Information.** We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can find your friends on Facebook, and invite<span style="background-color: red;">


your</span> <span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ur</span><span style="background-color: red;">ntacts</span> <span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">wh</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> do </span>n<span style="background-color: red;">o</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> h</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ve</span><span style="background-color: green;">cts</span> <span style="background-color: green;">who do not have


</span>Facebook accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>have uploaded your contacts’ information.


**Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:**


**Site activity information.** We keep track of some of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>friend), creating a photo album,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>sending a gift, poking another user, indicating you “like” a post, attending an event, or connecting with an application. In some<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.


**Access Device and Browser Information.** When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>that device about your browser type,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.


**Cookie Information.** We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>make Facebook easier to use, to make<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>our advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>back to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>buttons, and our advertisements.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook.


**Information we receive from third parties:**


**Facebook Platform.** We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities). Whenever<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you connect with a Platform<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>limited amount of information even before you connect with the application or website.<span style="background-color: green;">


Email

Forgot your password?
</span>


**Information from other websites.** We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:


 


We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the ads acted on their site). This data<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>quality of the advertisements you see.


We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>ads.


If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>with any particular user. If we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>below.


**Information from other users.** We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you in a photo, video, or place,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>provides friend details, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>indicates a relationship with you.


**3. Sharing information on Facebook.** 


This section explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared on Facebook. You should always consider your privacy settings<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>before sharing information on Facebook.


**Name and Profile Picture.** Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>not have privacy settings. If you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one). You can also control who can find<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you when searching on Facebook or on public search engines using the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Applications and Websites privacy setting.


**Contact Information.** Your contact information settings control (available when customizing your privacy settings) who can contact you on Facebook, and<span style="background-color: red;">


who</span> <span style="background-color: green;">wh</span><span style="background-color: red;">can see y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ur</span> c<span style="background-color: red;">ont</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ct i</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">formation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">see your contact information


</span>such as your email and phone number(s). Remember that none of this information is required except for your email<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>address, and you do not have to share your email address with anyone.<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


**Personal Information.** Your personal information settings control who can see your personal information, such as your religious and political views, if you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>choose to add them. We recommend<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>that you share this information using the friends of friends setting.


**Posts by Me.** You can select a privacy setting for every post you make using the publisher on our site. Whether you are uploading a photo or posting a status<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>update, you can control exactly<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>who can see it at the time you create it. Whenever you share something look for the lock icon. Clicking on the lock will bring<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>up a menu that lets you choose who will be able to see your post. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>you decide not to select your setting at the time you post the content, your content will be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>shared consistent with your Posts by Me default privacy 


(available when customizing your privacy settings).


**Gender and Birth Date.** In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the registration process. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>ask for your date of birth to verify<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>that you are 13 or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>delete them. You can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>fields from other users.


**Other.** Here are some other things to remember:


 


Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friends’ home pages and other pages they visit.


If another user tags you in a photo or video or at a place, you can remove the tag. You can also limit who can see that you have been tagged on your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>profile from your privacy settings.


Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>has been shared with others, it was<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.


You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users.


Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.


When you post information on another user’s profile or comment on another user’s post, that information will be subject to the other user’s privacy<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>settings.


If you use an external source to publish information to Facebook (such as a mobile application or a Connect site), you should check the privacy setting<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>for that post, as it is set by that external<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>source.


**“Everyone” Information.** Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, just like your name, profile picture, and connections. Such<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information may, for example, be accessed<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>by everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into Facebook), be indexed by third party search engines,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>without privacy limitations. Such information may also be associated with you,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>including your name and profile picture, even outside of Facebook, such as on public search engines and when you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>visit other sites on the internet. The default<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.” You can review and change the default settings in your<span style="background-color: red;"> privacy</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">privacy </span>settings. If you delete “everyone” content that you posted on Facebook, we will remove it from your Facebook profile, but have no control over its use outside<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>of Facebook.


**Minors.** We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the<span style="background-color: red;">


ability</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">du</span><span style="background-color: green;">bi</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">i</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">y</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">f</span> <span style="background-color: red;">sh</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">re an</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">ults</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to share and


</span>connect with minors, recognizing this may provide minors a more limited experience on Facebook


**4. Information You Share With Third Parties.**


**Facebook Platform.** As mentioned above, we do not own or operate the applications or websites that use Facebook Platform. That means that when you<span style="background-color: red;">


use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">tho</span>se <span style="background-color: red;">applica</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;">h</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> and w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">bsites</span> <span style="background-color: green;">applications and websites


</span>you are making your Facebook information available to someone other than Facebook. Prior to allowing them to access<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>use of your information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information. To learn more about Platform, visit our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>About Platform page.


**Connecting with an Application or Website.** When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you. The<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>term General Information includes<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your and your friends’ names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections, and any content shared using the Everyone<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>privacy setting. We may also make information about the location of<span style="background-color: red;"> your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">your computer or access device and your age available to applications and websites in </span>order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>content. If the application or website wants to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.


We give you tools to control how your information is shared with applications and websites that use Platform. For example, you can block all platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>applications and websites completely or block<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>specific applications from accessing your information by visiting your Applications and Websites privacy<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>setting or the specific application’s “About” page. You can also use your privacy settings to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>limit which of your information is available to “everyone”.


You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you share with them. We do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>violation to us on this help page and we will take action as necessary.


**When your friends use Platform.** If your friend connects with an application or website, it will be able to access your name, profile picture, gender, user ID,<span style="background-color: red;">


and</span> <span style="background-color: red;">inform</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">tio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;"> you have share</span>d <span style="background-color: green;">information you have shared


</span>with “everyone.” It will also be able to access your connections, except it will not be able to access your friend list. If you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>have already connected with (or have a separate account with) that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>website or application, it may also be able to connect you with your friend on that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>application or website. If the application or website wants to access any of your other content or information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>(including your friend list), it will have to obtain<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>specific permission from your friend. If your friend grants specific permission to the application or website, it will generally only be able to access<span style="background-color: red;"> content and</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">
</span><span style="background-color: green;">content and </span>information about you that your friend can access. In addition, it will only be allowed to use that content and information in connection with that friend. For<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>example, if a friend gives<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>an application access to a photo you only shared with your friends, that application could allow your friend to view or print the photo,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>but it cannot show that photo to anyone else.


We provide you with a number of tools to control how your information is shared when your friend connects with an application or website. For example, you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>can use your Application and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Websites privacy setting to limit some of the information your friends can make available to applications and websites. You can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>block all platform applications and websites completely or block<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>particular applications or websites from accessing your information. You can use your privacy<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>settings to limit which friends can access your information, or limit which of your information is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>available to “everyone.” You can also disconnect from a friend if<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you are uncomfortable with how they are using your information.


**Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications.** In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>provide General Information about<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-<span style="background-color: green;">


</span>approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>these cases we require these websites and applications<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these<span style="background-color: red;"> agreements include provisions</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">agreements include provisions </span>relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. You can disable instant


personalization on all pre-approved websites and applications using your Applications and Websites privacy setting. You can also block a particular pre-<span style="background-color: red;">


</span>approved website or application by clicking<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>"No Thanks" in the blue bar when you visit that application or website. In addition, if you log out of Facebook<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>before visiting a pre-approved application or website, it will not be able to access<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your information.


**Exporting Information.** You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>copy and paste functions, to capture,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>export (and in some cases, import) information from Facebook, including your information and information about you. <span style="background-color: red;">


</span>For example, if you share your phone number with your friends, they may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">



</span>use third party applications to sync that information with the address book on their<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>mobile phone.


**Advertisements.** Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>personalize advertising content. You may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>opt-out of the placement of cookies by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks.


**Links.** When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>read their privacy statements.


**5. How We Use Your Information**


We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:


**To manage the service.** We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features,<span style="background-color: red;">


and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">an</span><span style="background-color: red;">to provi</span>d<span style="background-color: red;">e</span> <span style="background-color: red;">you wi</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h cust</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">mer</span> <span style="background-color: green;">provide you with customer


</span>support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Responsibilities. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>some users.


**To contact you.** We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>on your account notifications page.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>We may include content you see on Facebook in the emails we send to you.


**To serve personalized advertising to you.** We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>asked us to provide your shipping<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>company who you are. You<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent,<span style="background-color: red;">


when</span> <span style="background-color: green;">when


</span>you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the criteria they selected.


**To serve social ads.** We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements<span style="background-color: red;">


more</span> <span style="background-color: red;">interesting and </span>more <span style="background-color: red;">ta</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">lored </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">eresting</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and more tailored to


</span>you and your friends. For example, if you connect with your favorite band’s page, we may display your name and profile<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>photo next to an advertisement for that page that is displayed to your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>friends. We only share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>page.


**To supplement your profile.** We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are<span style="background-color: red;">


tagged</span> <span style="background-color: red;">in a pho</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">agg</span><span style="background-color: red;">o or m</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ntione</span>d in <span style="background-color: green;">a photo or mentioned in


</span>a status update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.


**To make suggestions.** We use your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers, and other relevant information, to help you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>connect with your friends,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>including making suggestions to you and other users that you connect with on Facebook. For example, if another user imports the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>same email address as you do, we may suggest that you connect<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>with each other. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other people,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you can adjust your search visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>extent you choose to be visible in public search listings.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>You may also block specific individual users from being suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.


**To help your friends find you.** We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">



</span>through contact importers and search. <span style="background-color: green;">


</span>You can prevent other users from using your email address to find you using the search section of your privacy settings.


**Downloadable Software.** Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>data to us. We may not make a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a<span style="background-color: red;">


disclosure</span> <span style="background-color: red;">to you the first time you provi</span>d<span style="background-color: red;">e the </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">nformation to u</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> so that you </span>c<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">an decide whether y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">re</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you


</span>want to use that feature.


**Memorializing Accounts.** If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In such cases we restrict profile access to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>confirmed friends, and allow friends and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>family to write on the user’s Wall in remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>user’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.


**6. How We Share Information**


Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your communities — while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to<span style="background-color: red;">


restrict</span> <span style="background-color: red;">othe</span>r<span style="background-color: red;"> us</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;"> f</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">om access</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ng</span><span style="background-color: green;">ct</span> <span style="background-color: green;">other users from accessing


</span>some of your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>so. For example:


**When you make a payment.** When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Facebook, we will share transaction information with only<span style="background-color: red;">


those</span> th<span style="background-color: red;">ird parties necessary t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">se</span> <span style="background-color: green;">third parties necessary to


</span>complete the transaction. We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.


**When you invite a friend to join.** When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. <span style="background-color: red;">


</span>The invitation may also contain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information about other users your friend might know. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. You can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>see who has accepted your invitations, send reminders, and delete<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your friends’ email addresses on your invite history page. If your friend does not want us to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>keep their information, we will also remove it at their request by using this help page.


**When you choose to share your information with marketers.** You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that<span style="background-color: red;">


are</span> <span style="background-color: red;">not </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;">ssociat</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">d</span> <span style="background-color: red;">wi</span><span style="background-color: green;">no</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">h</span> <span style="background-color: green;">associated with


</span>Facebook through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your consent.


**To help your friends find you.** By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on Facebook to help your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>friends find you. However, you can<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>control who can see some of this information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We<span style="background-color: red;">


also</span> <span style="background-color: red;">p</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">rtner with emai</span>l<span style="background-color: red;"> and in</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">tant messaging pr</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">viders</span> <span style="background-color: red;">to hel</span>p<span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;"> thei</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">tn</span><span style="background-color: red;"> us</span>er<span style="background-color: red;">s</span> <span style="background-color: green;">with email and instant messaging providers to help their users


</span>identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Facebook to those users.


**To give search engines access to publicly available information.** We generally limit search engines’ access to our site. We may allow them to access<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information set to the “everyone”<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>setting (along with your name and profile picture) and your profile information that is visible to everyone. You can change the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>visibility of some of your profile information using the customize<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>section of your privacy settings. You can also prevent search engines from indexing your profile<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>using the Applications and Websites privacy setting.


**To help improve or promote our service.** Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we<span style="background-color: red;">


only</span> <span style="background-color: red;">d</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> so i</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;"> such a wa</span>y <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">that n</span>o <span style="background-color: green;">so in such a way that no


</span>individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.


**To provide you with services.** We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>parties to help host our website,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>send out email updates about Facebook, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when<span style="background-color: red;">


this</span> <span style="background-color: red;">occurs we implemen</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> reasonable contractual and tec</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">n</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">cal protection</span>s <span style="background-color: red;">t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">cc</span><span style="background-color: red;"> limit their </span>u<span style="background-color: red;">se of that info</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">mation</span> <span style="background-color: red;">to</span><span style="background-color: green;">we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to


</span>helping us provide the service.


**To advertise our services.** We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>based on the presence of a cookie, but in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.


**To offer joint services.** We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>services, we may share your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you before you use that service.


**To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.** We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>and civil matters) if we have a good<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information<span style="background-color: red;"> when we have a good faith belief it is necessary</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">when we have a good faith belief it is necessary </span>to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Rights and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.


**Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.** If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to<span style="background-color: red;">


the</span> <span style="background-color: red;">new owner so </span>th<span style="background-color: red;">at th</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">new owner so that the


</span>service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Privacy Policy.


**7. How You Can Change or Remove Information**


**Editing your profile.** You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>will be updated immediately.<span style="background-color: red;">
</span>


**Delete uploaded contacts.** If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page. You can delete the email<span style="background-color: red;">


addresses</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of friends you h</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ve invite</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">dresses</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of friends you have invited


</span>to join Facebook on your invite history page.


**Deactivating or deleting your account.** If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>will be able to see it, but it will<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>not be deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account<span style="background-color: red;"> settings page or</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">
settings page or </span>delete your account on this help page.


**Limitations on removal.** Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>elsewhere to the extent it has been<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>However, your name will no longer be associated with that information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>on Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another user’s profile and then<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”) <span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Additionally, we may retain certain information to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">your </span>information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access<span style="background-color: red;">


the</span> <span style="background-color: red;">informa</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ion t</span>h<span style="background-color: green;">e</span><span style="background-color: red;">rough</span> <span style="background-color: green;">inf</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">u</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">mation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">through our


</span>Platform after you disconnect from them.


**Backup copies.** Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.


**Non-user contact information.** If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to delete your address, you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>can do so on this help page.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to us later.


**8. How We Protect Information** 


We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Security Page.


**Steps we take to keep your information secure.** We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>information (such as credit card<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and<span style="background-color: red;"> may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our </span>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.


**Risks inherent in sharing information.** Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security<span style="background-color: red;">


measures</span> <span style="background-color: green;">m</span><span style="background-color: red;">ar</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> pe</span><span style="background-color: green;">asu</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">f</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">ct</span> <span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">a</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e</span> <span style="background-color: green;">perfect or
