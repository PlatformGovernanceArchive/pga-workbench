<p>This policy is effective as of November 26, 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Principles</strong></p>
<p>We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand</p>
<p>you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you</p>
<p>control of your information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your</p>
<p>networks and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.</p>
<p>Facebook follows two core principles:</p>
<p><strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you</p>
<p>put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you</p>
<p>control the users with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the Privacy page.</p>
<p><strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong> </p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you,</p>
<p>your friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how</p>
<p>and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please check out our privacy help page.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook's Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you</p>
<p>decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using Facebook, located at www.facebook.com and its</p>
<p>directly associated domains (collectively, "Facebook" or "Website")</p>
<p>By using or accessing Facebook, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Facebook is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose</p>
<p>mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This</p>
<p>privacy statement covers the site www.facebook.com and its directly associated domains. Because this Web site</p>
<p>wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its</p>
<p>privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding this statement, please contact us here. If you do not receive acknowledgement of</p>
<p>your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe Watchdog at</p>
<p>http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve</p>
<p>your concerns.</p>
<p><strong>EU Safe Harbor Participation</strong></p>
<p>We participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of</p>
<p>Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for</p>
<p>disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you have any complaints regarding</p>
<p>our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should visit our Help Center. If contacting us does not resolve your</p>
<p>complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you visit Facebook you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose</p>
<p>to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email</p>
<p>address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or</p>
<p>preference information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all</p>
<p>Facebook visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of</p>
<p>data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that</p>
<p>users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent</p>
<p>cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to</p>
<p>Facebook. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this</p>
<p>convenience feature.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform</p>
<p>searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various</p>
<p>channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In</p>
<p>most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see</p>
<p>your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable</p>
<p>period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
<p>Sign Up</p>
<p>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Facebook Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow</p>
<p>you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or</p>
<p>impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and</p>
<p>information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed</p>
<p>by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures</p>
<p>contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may</p>
<p>remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Facebook is a violation of the Facebook Terms of</p>
<p>Service and should be reported through the Help Center.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to</p>
<p>send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will send your friend an email or instant message in your</p>
<p>name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send up to two reminders to them. Facebook stores this</p>
<p>information to send invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow</p>
<p>you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us</p>
<p>through the Help Center to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging</p>
<p>services, and other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order</p>
<p>to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly</p>
<p>allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Facebook or send any</p>
<p>information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under</p>
<p>age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Facebook. In the event that we learn that we have collected</p>
<p>personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that</p>
<p>information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13,</p>
<p>please contact us through the form on our privacy help page.</p>
<p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information</p>
<p>about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well</p>
<p>as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable</p>
<p>you to connect with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you</p>
<p>notifications regarding new services offered by Facebook that we think you may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the</p>
<p>service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases</p>
<p>where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement</p>
<p>your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the</p>
<p>networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of</p>
<p>friends). Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the</p>
<p>Facebook network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This</p>
<p>is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however,</p>
<p>will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend,</p>
<p>member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the</p>
<p>service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive</p>
<p>an email alerting you to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, you may opt out of such emails from the Notifications page, though Facebook reserves the right to send</p>
<p>you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for</p>
<p>purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements</p>
<p>and promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the</p>
<p>world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if</p>
<p>you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar</p>
<p>one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company who you are.</p>
<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and</p>
<p>Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers and other users of</p>
<p>Facebook, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your</p>
<p>privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this</p>
<p>information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with</p>
<p>privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information</p>
<p>you provide to friends and networks through Facebook. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow</p>
<p>you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not provide contact information to</p>
<p>third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited</p>
<p>circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or,</p>
<p>3) permitted by you. For example:</p>
<p>Your News Feed and Wall may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and</p>
<p>network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your News Feed and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Wall on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your Privacy Settings page.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine "crawlers"<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>(e.g.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>information</span> <span style="background-color: green;">i</span><span style="background-color: red;">beyo</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">formation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">beyond</p>
<p></span>your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>wall postings).</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">use</p>
<p></span>third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>links (including<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>providers</span> <span style="background-color: red;">may have access to your </span>p<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">s</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">v</span><span style="background-color: red;">nal </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">nformation for use for a limite</span>d<span style="background-color: red;"> tim</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;"> in connection with the</span>s<span style="background-color: green;"> may hav</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> access</span></p>

<p></span>third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>purposes.</p>
<p>If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>your data. Before allowing any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Facebook<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>requires the Platform Developer to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>respect</span> <span style="background-color: red;">you</span>r<span style="background-color: red;"> privacy s</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">tting</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">pe</span><span style="background-color: red;"> and stri</span>ct<span style="background-color: red;">ly</span> <span style="background-color: green;">your</span><span style="background-color: red;">limits</span> <span style="background-color: green;">privacy settings and strictly limits</p>
<p></span>their collection, use, and storage of your information. However,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>while we have undertaken contractual and technical<span style="background-color: red;"> steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such </span>Platform Developers, we of course cannot and do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>agreements. Please note that Facebook does not screen or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>they may obtain in connection with Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>up to their own terms of service, privacy<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>additional obligations on you, so please<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Platform Application. You can report any<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform and we will<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>investigate any such claim and take<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such</p>
<p>accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit</p>
<p>possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>orders, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>companies, lawyers, agents or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>government agencies.</p>
<p>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another</p>
<p>company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>that</span> <span style="background-color: green;">that</p>

<p>Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a</p>
<p>purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>clear</span> <span style="background-color: red;">dis</span>cl<span style="background-color: red;">osur</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> of the </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ctivity info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mation being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your</span></p>

<p></span>with your friends.</p>
<p>To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the</p>
<p>service altogether, click here.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are</p>
<p>logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>technical</span> <span style="background-color: green;">technical</p>
<p></span>operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives information on users that are not logged<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>in, or on non-<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>continue</span> <span style="background-color: green;">continue</p>
<p></span>operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>When you use Facebook, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your</p>
<p>network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or other</p>
<p>information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of</p>
<p>information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or</p>
<p>when posting comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or other items , this information may</p>
<p>become publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Facebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other</p>
<p>web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each</p>
<p>and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party</p>
<p>advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also</p>
<p>download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as</p>
<p>"1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the</p>
<p>advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the</p>
<p>effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about</p>
<p>where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are</p>
<p>clicked. Facebook does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party</p>
<p>advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Facebook unless you</p>
<p>choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking</p>
<p>technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.</p>
<p>Facebook users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account.</p>
<p>Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on</p>
<p>the My Account page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not</p>
<p>be generally available to members of Facebook.</p>
<p>Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on</p>
<p>Facebook, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Facebook user) you generally cannot remove</p>
<p>such communications.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a</p>
<p>secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your</p>
<p>password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to</p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as</p>
<p>secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging</p>
<p>services. If you have any questions about the security of Facebook Web Site, please contact us through the Help</p>
<p>Center.</p>
