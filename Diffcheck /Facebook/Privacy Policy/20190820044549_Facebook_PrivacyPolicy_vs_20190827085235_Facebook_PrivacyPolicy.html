<p>the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use</p>
<p>Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses,</p>
<p>those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network</p>
<p>can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including</p>

<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>
<p>can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others</p>
<p>on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a</p>
<p>message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,</p>
<p>or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or</p>
<p>in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you</p>
<p>comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your</p>
<p>comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's</p>
<p>content, and that person can change the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you</p>

<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>

<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use</p>
<p>may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with</p>
<p>them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers</p>
<p>may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own</p>
<p>terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them,</p>
<p>including information your friends share with you, so they can provide</p>
<p>our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we</p>
<p>will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>
<p>address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</p>

<p>information that personally identifies you (information such as your</p>
<p>name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or</p>
<p>identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34</p>
<p>who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you</p>
<p>to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>

<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on</p>
<p>its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>How can I manage or delete information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete</p>
<p>that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have</p>
<p>shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos</p>
<p>and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information</p>
<p>that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you</p>
<p>don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you</p>

<p>How do we respond to legal requests or</p>
<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if</p>
<p>we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or</p>
<p>regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if</p>
<p>relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other</p>
<p>harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to</p>
<p>purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period</p>
<p>when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or</p>
<p>investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent</p>
<p>harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least</p>
<p>a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
