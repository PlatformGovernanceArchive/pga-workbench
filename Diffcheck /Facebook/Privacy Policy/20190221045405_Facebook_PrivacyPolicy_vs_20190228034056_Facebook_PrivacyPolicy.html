<p><strong>What kinds of information do we</strong></p>
<p><strong>collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The types of</p>
<p>information we collect depend on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access</p>
<p>and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings</p>

<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content,</p>
<p>communications and other information you provide when you use</p>
<p>our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or</p>
<p>share content, and message or communicate with others. This can</p>
<p>include information in or about the content you provide (like</p>
<p>metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was</p>
<p>created. It can also include what you see through features we</p>
<p>provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest</p>
<p>masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using</p>
<p>camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and</p>
<p>communications you and others provide to analyze context and</p>
<p>what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more</p>

<p>features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you</p>
<p>interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities.</p>
<p>For example, we log when you're using and have last used our</p>
<p>Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on</p>
<p>our Products. We also collect information about how you use</p>
<p>features like our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you</p>
<p>use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions</p>
<p>(such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a</p>
<p>donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction.</p>
<p>This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit</p>
<p>card number and other card information; other account and</p>
<p>authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Device Information</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers,</p>
<p>phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that</p>
<p>integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across</p>
<p>different devices you use. For example, we use information collected</p>
<p>about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the</p>
<p>content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on</p>
<p>another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you</p>
<p>took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a</p>
<p>different device. </p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes: </p>
<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware</p>
<p>and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage</p>
<p>space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors</p>
<p>performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or</p>
<p>backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish</p>
<p>humans from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as</p>
<p>from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other</p>
<p>identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the</p>
<p>same device or account).</p>
<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi</p>
<p>access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>

<p>mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP</p>
<p>address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other</p>
<p>devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like</p>
<p>help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including</p>
<p>cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the</p>

<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information</p>
<p>through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins</p>
<p>(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the</p>
<p>Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about your activities</p>
<p>off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you visit,</p>
<p>purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—</p>
<p>whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us</p>
<p>what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you</p>
<p>made in its store. We also receive information about your online and offline</p>
<p>actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights</p>
<p>to provide us with your information. </p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through</p>
<p>third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have</p>

<p><strong>How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to</p>
<p>provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to</p>
<p>personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram</p>
<p>Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as</p>
<p>groups or events you may be interested in or topics you may want to</p>
<p>follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are</p>
<p>unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences,</p>
<p>interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you</p>
<p>and others (including any data with special protections you choose to</p>
<p>provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people,</p>
<p>places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our</p>
<p>Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to</p>
<p>personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,</p>
<p>content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn</p>
<p>more about how we choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We</p>
<p>connect information about your activities on different Facebook</p>
<p>Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent</p>
<p>experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use</p>
<p>them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on</p>
<p>Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your</p>
<p>communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your</p>
<p>experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in</p>
<p>your registration information (such as your phone number) from one</p>
<p>Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>
<p>Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related</p>
<p>information-such as your current location, where you live, the</p>
<p>places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-</p>
<p>to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads,</p>
<p>for you and others. Location-related information can be based on</p>
<p>things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it),</p>
<p>IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of</p>
<p>Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information</p>
<p>we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by</p>
<p>conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting</p>
<p>new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face</p>
<p>recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and</p>
<p>camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create</p>
<p>may constitute data with special protections under the laws of your</p>
<p>country. Learn more about how we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook</p>
<p>Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have</p>
<p>control over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we</p>
<p>have about you-including information about your interests, actions</p>
<p>and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other</p>
<p>sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we</p>
<p>select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use</p>
<p>to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook</p>
<p>Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products,</p>
<p>such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and</p>
<p>other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and</p>
<p>services, and understand the types of people who use their services and</p>
<p>how people interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we</p>
<p>share information with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat</p>
<p>harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences,</p>
<p>maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on</p>
<p>and off of Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to</p>
<p>investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to</p>
<p>detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook</p>
<p>Security Help Center and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our</p>
<p>policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when</p>
<p>you contact us.</p>

<p>collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics</p>

<p><strong>How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,</p>
<p>you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,</p>
<p>the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use</p>
<p>Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those</p>
<p>people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can</p>
<p>also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement</p>
<p>with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has</p>
<p>viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,</p>
<p>including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram</p>
<p>username; any information you share with a public audience; information in</p>
<p>your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook</p>
<p>Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as</p>
<p>Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,</p>
<p>and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or</p>
<p>off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in</p>
<p>search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be</p>
<p>seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services</p>
<p>such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps,</p>
<p>websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your</p>
<p>visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>
<p>can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on</p>
<p>and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a</p>
<p>message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,</p>
<p>or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in</p>
<p>virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you</p>
<p>comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment</p>
<p>or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content,</p>
<p>and that person can change the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you</p>
<p>with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of</p>
<p>with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of</p>
<p>you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable</p>
<p>with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn</p>
<p>how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are</p>
<p>active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on</p>
<p>Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our</strong></p>
<p><strong>Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may</p>
<p>receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of</p>
<p>course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not</p>
<p>this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook</p>
<p>and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core</p>
<p>functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their</em></p>
<p><em>app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version,</em></p>
<p><em>we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</em></p>
<p><em>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and</em></p>
<p><em>email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell</p>
<p>any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on</p>
<p>how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third</p>
<p>parties we share information with: </p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and</p>
<p>businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,</p>
<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>
<p>information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted</p>
<p>to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and</p>
<p>other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page</p>
<p>or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their</p>
<p>ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address</p>
<p>that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless</p>
<p>you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic</p>
<p>and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen</p>
<p>by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes</p>
<p>software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We</p>
<p>also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an</p>
<p>action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to</p>
<p>provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and</p>
<p>contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure</p>
<p>services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer</p>
<p>service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and</p>
<p>academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation</p>
<p>that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal</p>
<p>requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>

<p><strong>How do the Facebook Companies</strong></p>
<p><strong>work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p><strong>How can I manage or delete</strong></p>
<p><strong>information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>

<p><strong>How do we respond to legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries;</p>
<p>or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability</p>
<p>of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
