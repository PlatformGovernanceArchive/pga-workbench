<p><strong>How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about creating engaging and customized experiences for people. We</p>
<p>use all of the information we have to help us provide and support our Services. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, improve and develop Services.</strong></p>
<p>We are able to deliver our Services, personalize content, and make</p>
<p>suggestions for you by using this information to understand how you use</p>
<p>and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to</p>
<p>and interested in on and off our Services. </p>
<p>We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to</p>
<p>you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a</p>
<p>picture by comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put</p>
<p>together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've</p>
<p>been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether we</p>
<p>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and</p>
<p>Tagging” settings. </p>
<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you</p>
<p>and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in</p>
<p>your area or tell your friends that you are nearby. </p>
<p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and</p>
<p>analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and</p>
<p>services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and</p>
<p>troubleshooting activities.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use your information to send you marketing communications,</p>
<p>communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our</p>
<p>policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when</p>
<p>you contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Show and measure ads and services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to improve our advertising and</p>
<p>measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our</p>
<p>Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services.</p>
<p>Learn more about advertising on our Services and how you can control</p>
<p>how information about you is used to personalize the ads you see.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to</p>
<p>promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as by</p>
<p>investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies. We</p>
<p>work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers, automated</p>
<p>systems, and advanced technology such as encryption and machine</p>
<p>learning. We also offer easy-to-use security tools that add an extra layer of</p>
<p>security to your account. For more information about promoting safety on</p>
<p>Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Help Center.</p>

<p><strong>How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing On Our Services</strong></p>
<p>People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by</p>
<p>sharing your information in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>People you share and communicate with.</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the</p>
<p>audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on</p>
<p>Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a customized</p>
<p>group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group. Likewise,</p>
<p>when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you send photos to</p>
<p>or message. </p>
<p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience, as</p>
<p>well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a</p>
<p>Facebook Page or another public forum. Public information is available to</p>
<p>anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through online</p>
<p>search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on TV. </p>
<p>In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download or</p>
<p>re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you</p>
<p>comment on another person’s post or like their content on Facebook, that</p>
<p>person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If their</p>
<p>audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>
<p><strong>People that see content others share about you.</strong></p>
<p>Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the</p>
<p>audience they choose. For example, people may share a photo of you,</p>
<p>mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you</p>
<p>that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s post,</p>
<p>social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from</p>
<p>someone they trust. Learn More.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our</strong></p>
<p><strong>Services.</strong></p>
<p>When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are</p>
<p>integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about what you</p>
<p>post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook</p>
<p>friends or use the Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the</p>
<p>game developer or website may get information about your activities in the</p>
<p>game or receive a comment or link that you share from their website on</p>
<p>Facebook. In addition, when you download or use such third-party</p>
<p>services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes your</p>
<p>username or user ID, your age range and country/language, your list of</p>
<p>friends, as well as any information that you share with them. Information</p>
<p>collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their</p>
<p>own terms and policies. </p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you</p>
<p>or others share with these apps and websites.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing within Facebook companies.</strong></p>
<p>We share information we have about you within the family of companies</p>
<p>that are part of Facebook. Learn more about our companies.</p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </p>
<p><strong>Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who</p>
<p>use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our companies and</p>
<p>provide free services to people around the world. </p>
<p>Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you:</p>
<p><strong>Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally</strong></p>
<p><strong>Identifiable Information Only).</strong></p>
<p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other</p>
<p>information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the</p>
<p>information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable</p>
<p>information is information like name or email address that can by itself be</p>
<p>used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising,</p>
<p>measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We</p>
<p>may provide these partners with information about the reach and</p>
<p>effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that</p>
<p>it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser</p>
<p>how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed</p>
<p>an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying</p>
<p>demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who likes</p>
<p>software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their</p>
<p>audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide</p>
<p>by our advertiser guidelines. </p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re</p>
<p>seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences if</p>
<p>you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners.</strong></p>
<p>We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners</p>
<p>who globally support our business, such as providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring</p>
<p>the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys.</p>
<p>These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way</p>
<p>that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements we enter into</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>Return to top</p>
<p><strong>How can I manage or delete</strong></p>
<p><strong>information about me?</strong></p>
<p>You can manage the content and information you share when you use Facebook through</p>
<p>the Activity Log tool. You can also download information associated with your Facebook</p>
<p>account through our Download Your Information tool. </p>
<p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and</p>
<p>others, including those described above. Information associated with your account will be</p>
<p>kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products</p>
<p>and services. </p>
<p>You can delete your account any time. When you delete your account, we delete things you</p>
<p>have posted, such as your photos and status updates. If you do not want to delete your</p>
<p>account, but want to temporarily stop using Facebook, you may deactivate your account</p>
<p>instead. To learn more about deactivating or deleting your account, click here. Keep in</p>
<p>mind that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will</p>
<p>not be deleted when you delete your account.</p>

<p><strong>How do we respond to legal</strong></p>
<p><strong>requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a</p>
<p>search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires</p>
<p>us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the</p>
<p>United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal</p>
<p>activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to</p>
<p>prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-</p>
<p>party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of</p>
<p>our Services. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related</p>
<p>to purchases made with Facebook, may be accessed, processed and retained for an</p>
<p>extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental</p>
<p>investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for</p>
<p>violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our</p>
<p>terms.</p>
