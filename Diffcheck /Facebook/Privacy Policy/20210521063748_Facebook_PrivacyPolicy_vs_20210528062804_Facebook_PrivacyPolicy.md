**Device Information**

**Device Information**

As described below, we collect information from and about the

computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices

you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this

information across different devices you use. For example, we use

information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to

better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when

you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or

to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed

you on your phone on a different device. 

Information we obtain from these devices includes:

hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available

storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.

Device operations:

Device operations: information about operations and behaviors

performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded

or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish

humans from bots).

Identifiers:

Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such

as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or

other identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated

with the same device or account).

**Information from partners.**

**Information from partners.**

Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information

through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins

(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the

Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about your activities

off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you

visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services

—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into

Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us

what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you

made in its store. We also receive information about your online and

offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have

the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through

third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have

lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data

to us. Learn more about the types of partners we receive data from.

How do we use this information?

We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and </span>to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described<span style="background-color: red;"> in the</span>

Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as

groups or events you may be interested in or topics you may want to

follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are

unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences,

interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you

and others (including any data with special protections you choose to

provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people,

places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our

Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to

personalize your Facebook and Instagram experience, including features,

content and recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn

Information across Facebook Products and devices:

Information across Facebook Products and devices: We

connect information about your activities on different Facebook

Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent

experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use

them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on

Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or

information-such as your current location, where you live, the

places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-

for you and others. Location-related information can be based on

things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect

it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of

Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).

information we have to develop, test and improve our Products,

including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and

troubleshooting new products and features.

recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and

camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create

may constitute data with special protections under the laws of

your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition

technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook

control over whether we use this technology for you.

we have about you-including information about your interests,

actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and

other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about

how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the

How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the

audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,

you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,

the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use

Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses,

those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network

can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including

engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts

see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. 

Public information

Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,

including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram

username; any information you share with a public audience; information

in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook

Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as

Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,

and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or

off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in

search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be

seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services

such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps,

websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 

Learn more about what information is public and how to control your

visibility on Facebook and Instagram.

**Content others share or reshare about you**

**Content others share or reshare about you**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who

can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others

on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the

audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a

message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,

or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or

in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you

comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your

comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's

content, and that person can change the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you

with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of

you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share

<span style="background-color: green;">you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share

</span>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are

**Products.**

**Products.**

People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are

Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our**

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our**

**Products.**

**Products.**

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that

use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information

about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with

your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a

website, the game developer or website can receive information about

your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share

from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such

third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and

any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use

may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with

them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other

information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about

any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers

may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).

Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own

terms and policies, not this one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and

Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)

will have access to all information you choose to share with them,

including information your friends share with you, so they can provide

our core functionality to you. 

Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even

further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'

access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app

in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we

will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to

include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email

address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets

demographic and other information that helps them understand

interactions with their Page or account.

**Advertisers.**

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing

their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share

information that personally identifies you (information such as your

name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or

identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we

provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for

example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34

who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better

understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you

to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
