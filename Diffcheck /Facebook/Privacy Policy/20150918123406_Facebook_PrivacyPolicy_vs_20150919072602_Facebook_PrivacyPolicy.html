<p>your activities.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide.</strong> We also collect content and information that other people provide when they use our Services, including information about</p>
<p>you, such as when they share a photo of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Your networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them, such as the people you</p>
<p>communicate with the most or the groups you like to share with. We also collect contact information you provide if you upload, sync or import this information (such as an</p>
<p>address book) from a device.</p>
<p><strong>Information about payments.</strong> If you use our Services for purchases or financial transactions (like when you buy something on Facebook, make a purchase in a game, or</p>
<p>make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes your payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other</p>
<p>card information, and other account and authentication information, as well as billing, shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Device information.</strong> We collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access our Services, depending on the</p>
<p>permissions you’ve granted. We may associate the information we collect from your different devices, which helps us provide consistent Services across your devices.</p>

<p>Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.</p>
<p>Connection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Information from websites and apps that use our Services.</strong> We collect information when you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Services (like when</p>

<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>

<p>how you use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to and interested in on and off our Services.</p>
<p>We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your</p>
<p>friend's pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can</p>
<p>control whether we suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and Tagging” settings.</p>

<p>friends that you are nearby.</p>
<p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new</p>
<p>products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong> We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies</p>
<p>and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>

<p>off our Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services. Learn more about advertising on our Services and how you can control how information</p>
<p>about you is used to personalize the ads you see.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety and security.</strong> We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as by</p>
<p>investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers, automated systems, and advanced</p>
<p>technology such as encryption and machine learning. We also offer easy-to-use security tools that add an extra layer of security to your account. For more information about</p>
<p>promoting safety on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Help Center.</p>
