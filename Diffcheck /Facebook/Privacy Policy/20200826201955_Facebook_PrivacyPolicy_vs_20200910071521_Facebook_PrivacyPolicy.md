third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and


websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use


will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your


Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).


Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.


Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our


own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share


with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.


*Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will*


*remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are*


*changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only*


*name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.*

**Law enforcement or legal requests.**


We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.


Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-</span>party partners in the


Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings.


**IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?**


Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and


Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products <span style="background-color: red;">that </span>you use. We also


process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with


their <span style="background-color: red;">T</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>erms and <span style="background-color: red;">P</span><span style="background-color: green;">p</span>olicies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take


appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact


with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.


**V. How can I manage or delete information about me?**


We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and <span style="background-color: red;">d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">let</span><span style="background-color: green;">ras</span>e your data. Learn more in your Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings.


We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> or until your account is deleted <span style="background-color: red;">–</span><span style="background-color: green;">-</span> whichever


comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things <span style="background-color: red;">such as the nature of the data, why it is co</span>l<span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">ik</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">cted</span> <span style="background-color: green;">th</span><span style="background-color: red;">and proc</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ssed,


and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and


</span>relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete<span style="background-color: red;">


that</span> <span style="background-color: green;">that


</span>query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after <span style="background-color: green;">6</span><span style="background-color: red;">six</span> months. If you submit a copy of your


government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more


about deletion of content <span style="background-color: red;">that </span>you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.


When you delete your account, we delete things <span style="background-color: red;">that </span>you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>recover<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>th<span style="background-color: red;">is</span><span style="background-color: green;">at</span> information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want<span style="background-color: red;">


to</span> <span style="background-color: red;">dele</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">o</span> <span style="background-color: green;">delete


</span>your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at<span style="background-color: red;">


any</span> <span style="background-color: green;">any</span><span style="background-color: red;">time,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">time,


</span>please visit the Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">S</span>ettings.


**VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?**


We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:


In response to a legal request (<span style="background-color: green;">lik</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to


do so</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> This may include respondin</span>g<span style="background-color: green;"> to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief


that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized


standards</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">


W</span><span style="background-color: red;"> a searc</span>h<span style="background-color: red;"> warrant, court ord</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r or subpoe</span>n<span style="background-color: green;"> we h</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ve a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of
