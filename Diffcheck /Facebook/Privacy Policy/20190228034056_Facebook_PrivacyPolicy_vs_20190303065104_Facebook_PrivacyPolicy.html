<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products,</p>
<p>including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and</p>
<p>camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special protections under the</p>
<p>laws of your country. Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in</p>
<p>Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and</p>
<p>you will have control over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information about your</p>
<p>interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you.</p>
<p>Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other</p>
<p>sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help</p>
<p>advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of</p>
<p>people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and services. Learn how we share information</p>

<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad</p>
<p>experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Center and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you</p>
<p>post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of</p>
<p>people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and</p>
<p>businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you ha</span>v<span style="background-color: red;">ic</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or</span> I<span style="background-color: red;">Ds, a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d other identifier</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">, such as</p>

<p><strong>Public i</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">formation</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Pro</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">ucts, including if they don't have an account. This includes your</p>

<p>our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and AP</span>I<span style="background-color: red;">D</span><span style="background-color: green;">s. Public information</p>
<p>can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline</p>
<p>media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to</p>
<p>share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For</p>
<p>example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare</p>
<p>that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see</p>
<p>the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people</p>
<p>can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or</p>
<p>messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently</p>
<p>active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can</p>
<p>receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a</p>
<p>Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities</p>
<p>in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and</p>
<p>websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use</p>
<p>will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your</p>
<p>Instagram follower</span>s (<span style="background-color: red;">or other</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our</p>

<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their</p>
<p>posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and</span> I<span style="background-color: red;">Ds a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">e</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">a</span><span style="background-color: red;">tin</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">ram</p>

<p>posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or</p>
<p>account</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We</span> <span style="background-color: green;">provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to</p>
<p>contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and</p>
<p>interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led</p>
<p>you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can</p>
<p>receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the</p>
<p>transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting</p>
<p>surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship</p>

<p>process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with</p>
<p>their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its ser</span>vi<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">c</span>e <span style="background-color: red;">and </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">upp</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">rt</span> <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> can take</p>
<p>appropriate action against those accounts on</span> Facebook<span style="background-color: green;">, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact</p>
<p>with Facebook Company</span> Products<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and related </span>s<span style="background-color: green;">u</span><span style="background-color: red;">ervi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">es described in t</span>h<span style="background-color: green;"> as und</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">V</span><span style="background-color: red;">Provide, personalize and improve our Products</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> How can I manage or delete information about me?</span></strong></p>
<p>We <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">use the info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mati</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n we ha</span>v<span style="background-color: red;">e to del</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">de you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.

<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to pro</span>v<span style="background-color: green;">id</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> our<span style="background-color: green;"> services and Facebook</span> Products, <span style="background-color: red;">including t</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and</p>
<p>relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that</p>
<p>query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your</p>
<p>government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content</p>
<p>you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover</p>
<p>that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete</p>
<p>your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time,</p>
<p>please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to</p>
<p>do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recogn</span>ize<span style="background-color: red;"> features an</span>d<span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>

<p>your registration information (such as your phone number) from one</p>
<p>Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different</p>

<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related</p>

<p>places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-</p>
<p>to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads,</p>
<p>for you and others. Location-related information can be based on</p>
<p>things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it),</p>
<p>IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of</p>
<p>Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information</p>
<p>we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by</p>
<p>conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting</p>
<p>new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face</p>
<p>recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and</p>
<p>camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create</p>
<p>may constitute data with special protections under the laws of your</p>
<p>country. Learn more about how we use face recognition</p>
<p>technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook</p>
<p>Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your</p>
<p>Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have</p>
<p>control over whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we</p>
<p>have about you-including information about your interests, actions</p>

<p><strong>How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the</p>
<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,</p>
<p>you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,</p>
<p>the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use</p>
<p>Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those</p>
<p>people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can</p>
<p>also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement</p>
<p>with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has</p>
<p>viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,</p>
<p>including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram</p>
<p>username; any information you share with a public audience; information in</p>
<p>your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook</p>
<p>Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as</p>
<p>Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,</p>
<p>and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or</p>
<p>off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in</p>
<p>search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be</p>
<p>seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services</p>
<p>such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps,</p>
<p>websites and other services that integrate with our Products. </p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your</p>
<p>visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>
<p>can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on</p>
<p>and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a</p>
<p>message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,</p>
<p>or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in</p>
<p>virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you</p>
<p>comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment</p>
<p>or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content,</p>
<p>and that person can change the audience later. </p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you</p>
<p>with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of</p>
<p>with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of</p>
<p>you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share</p>
<p>information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable</p>
<p>with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn</p>
<p>how to report the content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are</p>
<p>active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on</p>
<p>Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our</strong></p>
<p><strong>Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may</p>
<p>receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of</p>
<p>course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not</p>
<p>this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook</p>
<p>and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core</p>
<p>functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their</em></p>
<p><em>app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version,</em></p>
<p><em>we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</em></p>
<p><em>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and</em></p>
<p><em>email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell</p>
<p>any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on</p>
<p>how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third</p>
<p>parties we share information with: </p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and</p>
<p>businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,</p>

<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>
<p>information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted</p>
<p>to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and</p>
<p>other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page</p>
<p>or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their</p>
<p>ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address</p>
<p>that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless</p>
<p>you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic</p>
<p>and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen</p>
<p>by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes</p>
<p>software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We</p>
<p>also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an</p>
<p>action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to</p>
<p>provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a</p>
<p>seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public</p>
<p>information and other information you share with them, as well as the</p>
<p>information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and</p>
<p>contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who</p>
<p>support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure</p>
<p>services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer</p>
<p>service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and</p>
<p>academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation</p>
<p>that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement,</p>
<p>public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal</p>
<p>requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>

<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>

<p><strong>How can I manage or delete</strong></p>
<p><strong>information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>
<p>deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>

<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we</p>
<p>have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,</p>
<p>affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other</p>
<p>harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or</p>
<p>Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries;</p>
<p>or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide</p>
<p>information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability</p>
<p>of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases</p>
<p>made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is</p>
<p>the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain</p>
<p>information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat</p>
<p>abuse or other term violations.</p>
