<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use</p>
<p>may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with</p>
<p>them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers</p>
<p>may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own</p>
<p>terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them,</p>
<p>including information your friends share with you, so they can provide</p>
<p>our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we</p>
<p>will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>

<p>Data retention, account deactivation and</p>

<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete</p>
<p>that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of</p>
<p>content you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos</p>
<p>and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information</p>
