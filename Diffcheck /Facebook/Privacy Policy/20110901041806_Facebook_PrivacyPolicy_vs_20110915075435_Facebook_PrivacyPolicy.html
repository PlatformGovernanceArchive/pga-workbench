<p><strong>I. Information we receive and how it is used</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information we receive about you</strong></p>
<p>We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:</p>
<p><strong>Your information</strong></p>
<p>Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.</p>
<p><strong>Registration information</strong>: When you sign up for Facebook, you are required to provide your name, email address, birthday, and gender.</p>
<p><strong>Information you choose to share</strong>: Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Facebook, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a</p>
<p>friend's post.</p>
<p>It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Page or a website, tag a place in your post, find friends using our contact importers, or</p>
<p>indicate you are in a relationship.</p>
<p>Your name, profile picture, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public. </p>
<p>Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Information others share about you</strong></p>
<p>We receive information about you from your friends, such as when they tag you in a photo or at a location, or add you to a group.</p>
<p>We may also receive information about you from the games, applications, and websites you use, but only when you have given them permission. If you have given a game, application, or website</p>
<p>permission to post information on your Wall, you can remove it from your “Apps you use” setting.</p>
<p><strong>Other information we receive about you</strong></p>
<p>We also receive other types of information about you:</p>
<p>We receive data about you whenever you interact with Facebook, such as when you look at another person's profile, send someone a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on an ad, or</p>
<p>purchase Facebook Credits.</p>
<p>When you post things like photos or videos on Facebook, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.</p>
<p>We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access Facebook. This may include your IP address, location, the type of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For</p>
<p>example, we may get your GPS location so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby.</p>
<p>We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Facebook Platform or visit a site with a Facebook feature (such as a social plugin). This may include the date and time you</p>
<p>visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Facebook, your User ID.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get data from our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Facebook better. For</p>
<p>example, an advertiser may tell us how you responded to an ad on Facebook or on another site in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - those ads.</p>
<p>We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends. For example, we may put together data about you to determine which friends we should show you in your</p>
<p>News Feed or suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about</p>
<p>people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you.</p>
<p>When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services.</p>
<p>We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a</p>
<p>way that it is no longer associated with you. Similarly, when we receive data about you from our advertising partners or customers, we keep the data for 180 days. After that, we combine the data with</p>
<p>other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong></p>
<p>When we use the phrase "public information" (which we sometimes refer to as "Everyone information"), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly</p>
<p>available.</p>
<p><strong>Information you choose to make public</strong></p>
<p>Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>anyone</strong>, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see it.</p>
<p></span>Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p><strong>Log In</strong></p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p><strong>Sign Up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:</p>
<p>can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Facebook profile, User ID, etc.) even off Facebook</p>
<p>can show up when someone does a search on Facebook or on a public search engine</p>
<p>will be accessible to the games, applications, and websites you and your friends use</p>
<p>will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs such as our Graph API.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some</p>
<p>types of posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.</p>
<p>When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public. </p>
<p><strong>Information that is always publicly available</strong></p>
<p>The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always deactivate or delete your account.</p>
<p><strong>Profile Pictures</strong>: This helps your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your profile picture public, you can always delete it by hovering over your photo and clicking</p>
<p>"Change Picture."</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong>: This helps you see whom you will be sharing information with before you choose "Friends and Networks" as a custom audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can</p>
<p>leave the network.</p>
<p><strong>Username and User ID</strong>: These allow you to give out a custom link to your profile or Page, receive email at your Facebook email address, and help make Facebook Platform possible.</p>
<p><strong>Usernames and User IDs</strong></p>
<p>A Username (or Facebook URL) is a custom link to your profile that you can give out to people or post on external websites. If you have selected a username, it will always appear in the URL on your</p>
<p>profile page. If you have not selected a username, then the URL on your profile page will contain your User ID, which is what we use to identify your Facebook account.</p>
<p>If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the facebook.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type</p>
<p>facebook.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about</p>
<p>you through our APIs, such as our Graph API. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, locale (or language) and gender.</p>
<p>If you do not want your information to be accessible through our APIs, you can turn off all Platform applications from your Privacy Settings. If you turn off Platform you will no longer be able to use any</p>
<p>games or other applications.</p>
<p>If you want to see information available about you through our Graph API, just type <strong>https://graph.facebook.com/[User ID or Username]?metadata=1</strong> into your browser.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a Facebook email address, you will first have to select a public username. Your email address will include your public username like so: username@facebook.com. You can control</p>
<p>who can send you messages using your “How You Connect” settings. </p>
<p><strong>How we use the information we receive</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the</p>
<p>developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, we may use the information we receive about you:</p>
<p>as part of our efforts to keep Facebook safe and secure;</p>
<p>to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;</p>
<p>to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see;</p>
<p>to make suggestions to you and other users on Facebook, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a</p>
<p>friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it.</p>
<p>Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Facebook as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the</p>
<p>information we receive about you in new ways.</p>
<p>While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you</p>
<p>with others unless we have:</p>
<p>received your permission;</p>
<p>given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or</p>
<p>removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.</p>
<p>We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put together from the photos you've been tagged in. You can control whether we</p>
<p>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “How Tags work” settings.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting and deactivating your account</strong></p>
<p>If you want to stop using your account, you can either <strong>deactivate</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> it.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivate</strong></p>
<p>Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your profile, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to</p>
<p>delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account at: https://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php</p>
<p><strong>Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90</p>
<p>days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. You can delete your account at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account</p>
<p><strong>II. Sharing and finding you on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control each time you post</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you post content (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can</p>
<p>see it.</p>
<p>Choose this icon if you want to make something <strong>Public</strong>. Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see</p>
<p>or access it.</p>
<p>Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook </span><strong>F<span style="background-color: red;">acebook’s P</span>ri<span style="background-color: green;">ends</span><span style="background-color: red;">vacy Policy.</span></strong><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>Date of last revision: December 22, 2010</span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">This</span> <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">policy contains nine sections, and you can jump to eac</span>h<span style="background-color: red;"> by selecting the links bel</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ose this icon if you </span>w<span style="background-color: red;">:</p>
<p></span><span style="background-color: green;">ant to </span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">1. Introd</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">mize</span></strong><span style="background-color: green;"> your audience. You can also use this to hide your post from specific people.</p>
<p>If you do not make a selection, your information will be shared with the last audience you selected. If you want to change your selection later you can do that too on your profile.</p>
<p>If you tag someone, that person and their friends can see your post no matter what audience you selected. The same is true when you approve a tag someone else adds to your post.</p>
<p>Always think before you post. Just like anything else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on Facebook can be copied or re-shared by anyone who can see it.</p>
<p>When you comment on or "like" someone else's post, or write on their Wall, that person gets to select the audience.</p>
<p>You can control who can see the Facebook Pages you've "liked" by visiting your profile and clicking "Edit Profile."</p>
<p>Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of</p>
<p>posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">2. Inf</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">rmatio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">trol</span> <span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">We Recei</span>v<span style="background-color: green;">er your profil</span>e</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Whenever you add things to your profile you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it.</p>
<p>Choose this icon if you want to make something </span><strong><span style="background-color: red;">3</span><span style="background-color: green;">Public</strong></span>. <span style="background-color: green;">Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see</p>
<p>or access it.</p>
<p>Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook <strong>Friends</strong>.</p>
<p>Choose this icon if you want to <strong>Customize</strong> your audience. You can also use this to hide the item on your profile from specific people.</p>
<p>When you select an audience for your friend list, you are only controlling who can see it on your profile. We call this a profile visibility control. This is because your friend list is always available to the</p>
<p>games, applications and websites you use, and your friendships may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' profiles or in searches). For example, if you select "Only Me" as the audience for your</p>
<p>friend list, but your friend sets her friend list to "Public," anyone will be able to see your connection on your friend's profile.</p>
<p></span>S<span style="background-color: red;">har</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ng infor</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">at</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">on</span><span style="background-color: green;">larly,</span> <span style="background-color: green;">if y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u choose to hide your ge</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">der, it only hides it on your profile. This is because we, just like the applications you and your friends use, need to use your gender to refer to you properly on the</p>
<p>site.</p>
<p>When someone tags you in a post (such as a photo, status update or check-in), you can choose whether you want that post to appear on your profile. You can either approve each post individually or</p>
<p>approve all posts by your friends. If you approve a post and later change your mind, you can remove it from your profile.</p>
<p>To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as your email address or mobile number), to find you through Facebook search, as well as other tools</p>
<p>we provide, such as contact importers.</p>
<p>If you share your contact information (such as your email address or mobile number) with your friends, they may be able to use third party applications to sync that information with other address</p>
<p>books, including ones on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>Some things (like your name and profile picture) do not have sharing icons because they are always publicly available. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the</p>
<p>information will be publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>What your friends share about you</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong></p>
<p>A tag is a link to your profile. For example, if you are tagged in a post (such as a photo or a status update), that post will contain a link to your profile. If someone clicks on the link, they will see your public</p>
<p>information and anything else you let them see.</p>
<p>Anyone can tag you in anything. Once you are tagged in a post, you and your friends will be able to see it. For example, your friends may be able to see the post in their News Feed or when they search</p>
<p>for you. It may also appear on your profile.</p>
<p>You can choose whether a post you've been tagged in appears on your profile. You can either approve each post individually or approve all posts by your friends. If you approve a post and later change</p>
<p>your mind, you can always remove it from your profile.</p>
<p>If you do not want someone to tag you in their posts, we encourage you to reach out to them and give them that feedback. If that does not work, you can block them. This will prevent them from tagging</p>
<p>you going forward.</p>
<p>If you are tagged in a private space (such as a message or a group) only the people who can see the private space can see the tag. Similarly, it you are tagged in a comment, only the people who can</p>
<p>see the comment can see the tag.</p>
<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
<p>Your friends can add you to the Groups they are in. You can always leave a Group, which will prevent others from adding you to it again.</p>
<p><strong>About Pages</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Pages are public pages. Companies use Pages to share information about their products. Celebrities use Pages to talk about their latest projects. And communities use pages to discuss topics of</p>
<p>interest, everything from baseball to the opera.</p>
<p>Because Pages are public, information you share with a Page is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a comment on a Page, that comment can be used by the Page owner off of</p>
<p>Facebook, and anyone can see it.</p>
<p>When you "like" a Page, you create a connection to that Page. That connection is added to your profile and your friends may see it in their News Feeds. You may also receive updates from the Page in</p>
<p>your News Feed and your messages. You can remove the Pages you've "liked" from your profile.</p>
<p>Some Pages contain content that comes directly from the Page owner. Page owners can do this through online plugins, such as an iframe, and it works just like the games and other applications you use</p>
<p>through Facebook. Because this content comes directly from the Page owner, that Page may be able to collect information about you, just like any website.</p>
<p><strong>III. Sharing with other websites and applications</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Facebook Platform</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Platform (or simply Platform) refers to the way we help you share your information with the games, applications, and websites you and your friends use. Facebook Platform also lets you bring</p>
<p>your friends with you, so you can connect with them off of Facebook. In these two ways, Facebook Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more personalized and social.</p>
<p>Remember that these games, applications and websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of Facebook, so you should always make sure to read their terms</p>
<p>of service and privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling what information you share with applications</strong></p>
<p>When you go to a game or application, or connect with a website using Facebook Platform, we give the game, application, or website (sometimes referred to as just "Applications" or "Apps") your User ID,</p>
<p>as well your friends' User IDs (or your friend list).</p>
<p>Your friend list helps the application make your experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that application. Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience because it can</p>
<p>connect your account on that application with your Facebook account, and it can access your public information. This includes the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is</p>
<p>always publicly available. If the application needs additional information, it will have to ask you for specific permission.</p>
<p>The “Apps you use” setting lets you control the applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these applications, as well as the last time an application accessed your information. You</p>
<p>can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your User ID is no longer given to applications, even when your friends</p>
<p>use those applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or websites through Facebook.</p>
<p>Applications also get your age range, locale, and gender when you and your friends visit them. Age range (e.g., 18-21) lets applications provide you with age-appropriate content. Locale (e.g., en-US)</p>
<p>lets applications know what language you speak. Gender lets applications refer to you correctly. If you do not want applications to receive this information about you, you can turn off all Facebook</p>
<p>applications using your Privacy Settings.</p>
<p>Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that device (such as your public information).</p>
<p>If you say okay, those applications will not be able to access any other information about you without asking specific permission from you or your friends.</p>
<p>Instant Personalization sites receive your User ID and friend list when you visit them. </p>
<p><strong>Controlling what is shared when the people you share with use applications</strong></p>
<p>Just like when you share information by email or elsewhere on the web, information you share on Facebook can be re-shared. This means that if you share something on Facebook, anyone who can see it</p>
<p>can share it with others, including the games, applications, and websites they use.</p>
<p>Your friends and the other people you share information with often want to share your information with applications to make their experiences on those application more personalized and social. For</p>
<p>example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows them to see what their friends are listening to. To get the full benefit of that application, your friend would want to give the</p>
<p>application her friend list – which includes your User ID – so the application knows which of her friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you “like” on Facebook. If you have</p>
<p>made that information public, then the application can access it just like anyone else. But if you’ve shared your likes with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for permission to share</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>You can control most of the information other people can share with applications from the “Apps and Websites” settings page. But these controls do not let you limit access to your public information and</p>
<p>friend list.</p>
<p>If you want to completely block applications from getting your information, you will need to turn off all Platform applications. This means that you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or</p>
<p>websites.</p>
<p>If an application asks permission from someone else to access your information, the application will be allowed to use that information only in connection with the person that gave the permission and no</p>
<p>one else.</p>
<p><strong>Logging in to another site using</span> Facebook</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Facebook Platform also lets you log into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log in using Facebook, we give the site your User ID, but we do not share your email</p>
<p>address or password with that website.</p>
<p>If you already have an account on that website, the site may also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account. Sometimes it does this using what is called an "email hash", which is similar</p>
<p>to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address. Only the email addresses in this case are encrypted so no email addresses are actually shared between Facebook and the website.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">H</span><span style="background-color: red;">4. Inf</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">rmation</span> <span style="background-color: red;">You Share W</span>it<span style="background-color: red;">h</span> <span style="background-color: green;">wo</span><span style="background-color: red;">Thi</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">k</span><span style="background-color: red;">d Partie</span>s</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">The website sends over an encrypted version of your email address, and we match it with a database of email addresses that we have also encrypted. If there is a match, then we tell the website the</p>
<p>User ID associated with the email address. This way, when you log into the website using Facebook, the website can link your Facebook account to your account on that website.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Ab</span><span style="background-color: red;">5. H</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">w We Use Yo</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">r Informa</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;"> s</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">cial plugi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">s</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories (such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Facebook content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While</p>
<p>you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes directly from Facebook.</p>
<p>If you make something public using a plugin, such as posting a public comment on a newspaper's website, then that website can access your comment (along with your User ID) just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Websites that use social plugins can sometimes tell that you have engaged with the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button in a social plugin.</p>
<p>We receive data when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data for 90 days. After that, we remove your name or any other personally identifying information from the data, or combine it</p>
<p>with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Ab</span><span style="background-color: red;">6.

<p><span style="background-color: green;">Instant personalization is a way for Facebook to help partner sites (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) create a more personalized and social experience than a social plugin can offer. When you visit a</p>
<p>site using instant personalization, it will know some information about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because instant personalization sites can access your User ID, your friend list, and</p>
<p>your public information.</p>
<p>The first time you visit an instant personalization site, you will see a notification letting you know that the site has partnered with Facebook to provide a personalized experience.</p>
<p>The notification will give you the ability to disable or turn off instant personalization for that site. If you do that, that site is required to delete all of the information about you it received from Facebook. In</p>
<p>addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your information in the future, even when your friends use that site.</p>
<p>If you decide that you do not want to experience instant personalization for all partner sites, you can disable instant personalization from the “Apps and Websites” settings page.</p>
<p>If you turn off instant personalization, partner sites will not be able to access your public information, even when your friends visit those sites.</p>
<p>If you turn off an instant personalization site after you have been using it or visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access your data), it will not automatically delete your</p>
<p>data. But the site is contractually required to delete your data if you ask it to.</p>
<p></span><strong><span style="background-color: red;">7. </span>How <span style="background-color: red;">You Can Change or Remove Informat</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">t w</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">rks</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this agreement requires that the partner delete your</p>
<p>data if you turn off instant personalization when you first visit the site. It also prevents the partner from accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site.</p>
<p>Instant personalization partners sometimes use an email hash process to see if any of their users are on Facebook and get those users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on</p>
<p>Facebook using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are encrypted so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually required not to use your User ID for</p>
<p>any purpose (other than associating it with your account) until you or your friends visit the site.</p>
<p>When you visit an instant personalization site, we provide the site with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age range, locale, and gender). The site can then connect your account on that site</p>
<p>with your friends' accounts to make the site instantly social. The site can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it receives, which it can use to make the site instantly</p>
<p>personalized. For example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to suggest songs you may like, and access your friends' music interests to let you know what they are listening to. Of</p>
<p>course it can only access you or your friends’ music interests if they are public. If the site wants any additional information, it will have to get your specific permission.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">Your Public Search setting controls whether people who enter your name on a public search engine may see your public profile (including in sponsored results). You can find your Public Search setting on</p>
<p>the “Apps and Websites” settings page. You can preview your public profile at: </span><strong><span style="background-color: red;">9</span><span style="background-color: green;">http://www</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">fac</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Oth</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r Ter</span><span style="background-color: green;">book.co</span>m<span style="background-color: green;">/[Your U</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">ername or UserID]?p</span></strong></p>

<p>If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a public search engine, you may still see a preview of your profile. This is because some search engines cache information for a</p>
<p>period of time. You can learn more about how to request a search engine to remove you from cached information at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=13323</p>

<p>We</span> <span style="background-color: green;">do not share any of your information with advertisers (unless, of course, you give us permission).</p>
<p>When an advertiser creates an ad on Facebook, they are given the opportunity to choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords, and any other information we receive or can tell about</p>
<p>you and other users. For example, an advertiser can choose to target 18 to 35 year-old women who live in the United States and like basketball.</p>

<p>advertiser who that person is.</p>
<p></span>A<span style="background-color: green;">fter the ad runs, we pro</span>v<span style="background-color: green;">id</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nu</span><span style="background-color: green;"> adv</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">rtisers with reports on how their ads performed. For example we give advertisers reports telling them how many users saw or clicked on their ads. But these reports are</p>
<p>anonymous. We do not tell advertisers who saw or clicked on their ads.</p>
<p>Advertisers sometimes place cookies on your computer in order to make their ads more effective. Learn more at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</p>
<p>Sometimes we allow advertisers to target a category of user</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">like a "moviegoer" or a "sci-fi fan." We do this by bundling characteristics that we believe are related to the category. For example, if a</p>
<p>person "likes" the "Star Trek" </span>Pa<span style="background-color: red;">lo</span><span style="background-color: green;">ge</span> <span style="background-color: red;">Al</span><span style="background-color: green;">and men</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">i</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ns "Star Wars" when they check into a movie theater</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">CA</p>
<p>94304</span><span style="background-color: green;">we may conclude that this person is likely to be a sci-fi fan</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">Ads + social context</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Ads are sometimes paired with social actions your friends have taken. For example, an ad for a sushi restaurant may be paired with a news story that one of your friends likes that restaurant's</p>
<p>Facebook page.</p>
<p>This is the same type of news story that could show up in your News Feed, only we place it next to a paid advertisement to make that ad more relevant and interesting.</p>
<p>When you show up in one of these news stories, we will only pair it with ads shown to your friends. If you do not want to appear in stories paired with Facebook Ads, you can opt out using your “Edit social</p>
<p>ads” setting.</p>
<p>Learn what happens when you click "Like" on an advertisement or an advertiser's Facebook Page at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=19399</p>
<p>We may serve ads with social context (or serve just social context) on other sites. These work just like the ads we serve on Facebook - the advertisers do not receive any of your information.</p>
<p>We sometimes allow businesses or anyone else to sponsor stories like the ones that show up in your News Feed, subject to the audience set for that story. While these are sponsored, they are different</p>
<p>from ads because they don't contain a message from the person that sponsored them. Your friends will see these stories even if you have opted out of the "Show my social actions in Facebook Ads"</p>
<p>setting </p>
<p>Your “Show my social actions in Facebook Ads” setting does not control ads about Facebook's services and features. </p>
<p>Games, applications and websites can serve ads directly to you if they have your User ID.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored stories</strong></p>
<p>Many of the things you do on Facebook (like "liking" a Page) are posted to your Wall and shared in News Feed. But there's a lot to read in News Feed. That's why we allow people to "sponsor" your stories</p>
<p>to make sure your friends see them. For example, if you RSVP to an event hosted by a local restaurant, that restaurant may want to make sure your friends see it so they can come too. If they do</p>
<p>sponsor a story, that story will appear in the same place ads usually do under the heading "Sponsored Stories" or something similar. Only people that could originally see the story can see the sponsored</p>
<p>story, and no personal information about you (or your friends) is shared with the sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Featured content</strong></p>
<p>We like to tell you about some of the features your friends use on Facebook to help you have a better experience. For example, if your friend uses our friend finder tool to find more friends on Facebook,</p>
<p>we may tell you about it to encourage you to use it as well. This of course means your friend may similarly see suggestions based on the things you do. But we will try to only show it to friends that could</p>
<p>benefit from your experience.</p>
<p><strong>V. Minors and safety</strong></p>
<p>We take safety issues very seriously, especially with children, and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet practices. To learn more, visit our Safety Center.</p>
<p>To protect minors, we may put special safeguards in place (such as placing restrictions on the ability of adults to share and connect with them), recognizing this may provide minors a more limited</p>
<p>experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Some other things you need to know</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe harbor</strong></p>
<p>Facebook complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. As part of our</p>

<p><strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm</strong></p>
<p></span>We<span style="background-color: red;">b</span> <span style="background-color: green;">may </span>s<span style="background-color: red;">it</span><span style="background-color: green;">har</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> This may include responding</p>
<p>to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent</p>
<p>with internationally recognized standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect</p>
<p>ourselves and you from violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. </p>
<p><strong>Access requests</strong></p>
<p>We provide initial responses to access requests within a reasonable period of time, typically within thirty days. You can also download a copy of everything you've put into Facebook by visiting your</p>
<p>“Account Settings” and clicking on “Download a copy of your Facebook data”.</p>
<p><strong>Notifications and Other Messages</strong></p>
<p>We may send you notifications and other messages using the contact information we have for you, like your email address. You can control most of the notifications you receive, including ones from Pages</p>
<p>you like and applications you use, using your “Notifications” settings. </p>
<p><strong>Friend finder</strong></p>
<p>We offer tools to help you upload your friends' contact information so that you can find your friends on Facebook, and invite friends who do not use Facebook to join. If you do not want us to store this</p>
<p>information, visit this help page at: https://www.facebook.com/contact_importer/remove_uploads.php</p>
<p>If you give us your password, we will delete it after you upload your friends' contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Invitations</strong></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to join Facebook, we send a message on your behalf using your name, and up to two reminders. We may also include names and pictures of other people your friend might know</p>
<p>on Facebook. The invitation will also give your friend the opportunity to opt out of receiving other invitations to join Facebook. </p>
<p><strong>Memorializing accounts</strong></p>
<p>We may memorialize the account of a deceased person. When we memorialize an account we keep the profile on Facebook, but only let friends and family look at pictures or write on the user's Wall in</p>
<p>remembrance. You can report a deceased person's profile at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased</p>
<p>We also may close an account if we receive a formal request from the person's next of kin.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data that we store on your computer, mobile phone or other device to make Facebook easier to use, make our advertising better, and to protect you (and Facebook). For</p>
<p>example, we may use them to know you are logged in to Facebook, to help you use social plugins and share buttons, or to know when you are interacting with our advertising or Platform partners. We</p>
<p>may also ask advertisers to serve ads to computers, mobile phones or other devices with a cookie placed by Facebook (although we would not share any other information with that advertiser). Most</p>
<p>companies on the web use cookies (or similar technological methods), including our advertising and Platform partners. You can always remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your</p>
<p>browser), but it may affect your ability to use Facebook. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=176591669064814</span></p>

<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information About Yourself.</strong> When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to connect with</p>
<p>your friends, schools, and employers. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once</p>
<p>you register you can provide other information about yourself by connecting with, for example, your current city, hometown, family, relationships, networks, activities, interests, and places. You can also</p>
<p>provide personal information about yourself, such as your political and religious views.</p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong> One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link,</p>
<p>create an event or a group, make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share</p>
<p>on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong> We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook. If you do not want us to store your payment source account number, you can remove it</p>
<p>using your payments page. </p>
<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can find your friends on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have Facebook</p>
<p>accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have uploaded</p>
<p>your contacts’ information.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of some of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a friend), creating a photo album, sending a gift,</p>
<p>poking another user, indicating you “like” a post, attending an event, or connecting with an application. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For</p>
<p>example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.</p>
<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type,</p>
<p>location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make our</p>
<p>advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to</p>
<p>Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share buttons, and</p>
<p>our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities). Whenever you connect with a Platform application or</p>
<p>website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of</p>
<p>information even before you connect with the application or website.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing,</p>
<p>commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
<p>We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.</p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these</p>
<p>programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you in a photo, video, or place, provides friend details, or indicates a</p>
<p>relationship with you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sharing information on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>This section explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared on Facebook. You should always consider your privacy settings before sharing information on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Name and Profile Picture.</strong> Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have privacy settings. If you are</p>
<p>uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one). You can also control who can find you when searching on Facebook or on public search engines using the Applications</p>
<p>and Websites privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> Your contact information settings control (available when customizing your privacy settings) who can contact you on Facebook, and who can see your contact information such as</p>
<p>your email and phone number(s). Remember that none of this information is required except for your email address, and you do not have to share your email address with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Your personal information settings control who can see your personal information, such as your religious and political views, if you choose to add them. We recommend that you</p>
<p>share this information using the friends of friends setting.</p>
<p><strong>Posts by Me.</strong> You can select a privacy setting for every post you make using the publisher on our site. Whether you are uploading a photo or posting a status update, you can control exactly who can</p>
<p>see it at the time you create it. Whenever you share something look for the lock icon. Clicking on the lock will bring up a menu that lets you choose who will be able to see your post. If you decide not to</p>
<p>select your setting at the time you post the content, your content will be shared consistent with your Posts by Me default privacy</p>
<p>(available when customizing your privacy settings).</p>
<p><strong>Gender and Birth Date.</strong> In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the registration process. We ask for your date of birth to verify that you are</p>
<p>13 or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot delete them. You</p>
<p>can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such fields from other users</span>.</p>

<p>distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.</p>
<p>You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users.</p>
<p>Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.</p>
<p>When you post information on another user’s profile or comment on another user’s post, that information will be subject to the other user’s privacy settings.</p>
<p>If you use an external source to publish information to Facebook (such as a mobile application or a Connect site), you should check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.</p>
<p><strong>“Everyone” Information.</strong> Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, just like your name, profile picture, and connections. Such information may, for example, be accessed by</p>
<p>everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into Facebook), be indexed by third party search engines, and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others without</p>
<p>privacy limitations. Such information may also be associated with you, including your name and profile picture, even outside of Facebook, such as on public search engines and when you visit other sites on</p>
<p>the internet. The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.” You can review and change the default settings in your privacy settings. If you delete</p>
<p>“everyone” content that you posted on Facebook, we will remove it from your Facebook profile, but have no control over its use outside of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Minors.</strong> We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the ability of adults to share and connect with</p>
<p>minors, recognizing this may provide minors a more limited experience on Facebook</p>
<p><strong>4. Information You Share With Third Parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> As mentioned above, we do not own or operate the applications or websites that use Facebook Platform. That means that when you use those applications and websites you are</p>
<p>making your Facebook information available to someone other than Facebook. Prior to allowing them to access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their use of your</p>
<p>information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized information. To learn more</p>
<p>about Platform, visit our About Platform page.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting with an Application or Website.</strong> When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you. The term General Information includes your and</p>
<p>your friends’ names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections, and any content shared using the Everyone privacy setting. We may also make information about the location of your computer or</p>
<p>access device and your age available to applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content. If the application</p>
<p>or website wants to access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.</p>
<p>We give you tools to control how your information is shared with applications and websites that use Platform. For example, you can block all platform applications and websites completely or block specific</p>
<p>applications from accessing your information by visiting your Applications and Websites privacy setting or the specific application’s “About” page. You can also use your privacy settings to limit which of your</p>
<p>information is available to “everyone”.</p>
<p>You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee</p>
<p>that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this help page and we will take action as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>When your friends use Platform.</strong> If your friend connects with an application or website, it will be able to access your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, and information you have shared with</p>
<p>“everyone.” It will also be able to access your connections, except it will not be able to access your friend list. If you have already connected with (or have a separate account with) that website or</p>
<p>application, it may also be able to connect you with your friend on that application or website. If the application or website wants to access any of your other content or information (including your friend</p>
<p>list), it will have to obtain specific permission from your friend. If your friend grants specific permission to the application or website, it will generally only be able to access content and information about</p>
<p>you that your friend can access. In addition, it will only be allowed to use that content and information in connection with that friend. For example, if a friend gives an application access to a photo you</p>
<p>only shared with your friends, that application could allow your friend to view or print the photo, but it cannot show that photo to anyone else.</p>
<p>We provide you with a number of tools to control how your information is shared when your friend connects with an application or website. For example, you can use your Application and Websites privacy</p>
<p>setting to limit some of the information your friends can make available to applications and websites. You can block all platform applications and websites completely or block particular applications or</p>
<p>websites from accessing your information. You can use your privacy settings to limit which friends can access your information, or limit which of your information is available to “everyone.” You can also</p>
<p>disconnect from a friend if you are uncomfortable with how they are using your information.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications.</strong> In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to provide General Information about you to</p>
<p>pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or</p>
<p>application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In these cases we require these</p>
<p>websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these agreements include provisions relating to the</p>
<p>access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. You can disable instant personalization on all pre-approved websites and applications</p>
<p>using your Applications and Websites privacy setting. You can also block a particular pre-approved website or application by clicking "No Thanks" in the blue bar when you visit that application or website.</p>
<p>In addition, if you log out of Facebook before visiting a pre-approved application or website, it will not be able to access your information.</p>
<p><strong>Exporting Information.</strong> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or copy and paste functions, to capture, export</p>
<p>(and in some cases, import) information from Facebook, including your information and information about you. For example, if you share your phone number with your friends, they may use third party</p>
<p>applications to sync that information with the address book on their mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may opt-out</p>
<p>of the placement of cookies by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks. Facebook does not</p>
<p>share personally identifiable information with advertisers unless we get your permission.</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>5. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support.</p>
<p>We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous</p>
<p>activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates on your account notifications page. We may</p>
<p>include content you see on Facebook in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you asked us to provide your shipping address</p>
<p>to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes</p>
<p>we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate</p>
<p>audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment company who you are. You can see</p>
<p>the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an</p>
<p>advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.</p>
<p><strong>To serve social ads.</strong> We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and</p>
<p>your friends. For example, if you connect with your favorite band’s page, we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that page that is displayed to your friends. We only</p>
<p>share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status</p>
<p>update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.</p>
<p><strong>To make suggestions.</strong> We use your information, including the addresses you import through our contact importers, to make suggestions to you and other users on Facebook. For example, if another</p>
<p>user imports the same email address as you do, we may suggest that you add each other as friends. Similarly, if one of your friends uploads a picture of you, we may suggest that your friend tag you in</p>
<p>the picture. We do this by comparing your friend’s pictures to information we’ve put together from the photos you’ve been tagged in. We may also suggest that you use certain tools and features based</p>
<p>on what your friends have used. You can control whether we suggest that another user add you as a friend through your “search for you on Facebook” privacy setting. You can control whether we</p>
<p>suggest that another user tag you in a photo by clicking customize from your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through contact importers and search. You can</p>
<p>prevent other users from using your email address to find you using the search section of your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal</p>
<p>disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If we believe it is</p>
<p>not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to</p>
<p>write on the user’s Wall in remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p>
<p><strong>6. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your communities — while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing some of</p>
<p>your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example:</p>
<p><strong>When you make a payment.</strong> When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Facebook, we will share transaction information with only those third parties necessary to complete</p>
<p>the transaction. We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.</p>
<p><strong>When you invite a friend to join.</strong> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. The invitation may also contain information</p>
<p>about other users your friend might know. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. You can see who has accepted your invitations, send reminders, and delete your friends’ email</p>
<p>addresses on your invite history page. If your friend does not want us to keep their information, we will also remove it at their request by using this help page.</p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</strong> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Facebook</p>
<p>through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can control</p>
<p>who can see some of this information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users identify which</p>
<p>of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote Facebook to those users.</p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search engines’ access to our site. We may allow them to access information set to the “everyone” setting</p>
<p>(along with your name and profile picture) and your profile information that is visible to everyone. You can change the visibility of some of your profile information using the customize section of your</p>
<p>privacy settings. You can also prevent search engines from indexing your profile using the Applications and Websites privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service.</strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual</p>
<p>user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out</p>
<p>email updates about Facebook, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access</p>
<p>to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the</p>
<p>service.</p>
<p><strong>To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so</p>
<p>will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to</p>
<p>facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you use that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith</p>
<p>belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under</p>
<p>the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief</p>
<p>it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may</p>
<p>include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can</p>
<p>continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>7. How You Can Change or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing your profile.</strong> You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page. You can delete the email addresses of friends you have invited to join</p>
<p>Facebook on your invite history page.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be</p>
<p>deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are</p>
<p>asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is</p>
<p>permanently deleted from Facebook. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account settings page or delete your</p>
<p>account on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with</p>
<p>others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on Facebook. (For</p>
<p>example, if you post something to another user’s profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”) Additionally, we may retain certain</p>
<p>information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your</p>
<p>information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to delete your address, you can do so on this help page. However, that</p>
<p>request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.</p>
<p><strong>8. How We Protect Information</strong> </p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and</p>
<p>passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or</p>
<p>otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for</p>
<p>violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We</p>
<p>cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you</p>
<p>share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Facebook. You can reduce these risks by using</p>
<p>common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.</p>
<p><strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>9. Other Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Facebook Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to</p>
