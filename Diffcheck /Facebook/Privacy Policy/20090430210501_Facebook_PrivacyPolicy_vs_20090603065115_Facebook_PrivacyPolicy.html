<p>This policy is effective as of November 26, 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Principles</strong></p>
<p>We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We</p>
<p>understand you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that</p>
<p>is why we give you control of your information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in</p>
<p>your profile to your networks and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.</p>
<p>Facebook follows two core principles:</p>
<p><strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong> </p>
<p>Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what</p>
<p>information you put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and</p>
<p>groups you join. And you control the users with whom you share that information through the privacy</p>
<p>settings on the Privacy page.</p>
<p><strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong> </p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to</p>
<p>you, your friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control</p>
<p>how and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please check out our</p>
<p>privacy help page.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook's Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Facebook's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal</p>
<p>information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using Facebook, located at</p>
<p>www.facebook.com and its directly associated domains (collectively, "Facebook" or "Website")</p>

<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you visit Facebook you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly</p>
<p>choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with</p>
<p>our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name,</p>
<p>your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other</p>
<p>personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all</p>
<p>Facebook visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies</p>

By default,</p>
<p>we use a persistent cookie that stores your logi</span>n ID <span style="background-color: red;">cookies</p>
<p>to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default,</p>
<p>we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID </span>(but not your password) to make it easier for you to</p>
<p>login when you come back to Facebook. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your</p>
<p>browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform</p>
<p>searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through</p>
<p>various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized</p>
<p>features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have</p>
<p>sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior</p>
<p>version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Facebook Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we</p>
<p>allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures</p>
<p>are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to</p>
<p>share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post</p>
<p>on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any</p>
<p>privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even</p>
<p>after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users</p>
<p>have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Facebook is a violation of the Facebook Terms</p>
<p>of Service and should be reported through the <span style="background-color: green;">H</span><span style="background-color: red;">form on our privacy h</span>elp <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">pag</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nter</span>.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information</p>
<p>needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will send your friend an email or</p>
<p>instant message in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send up to two reminders to</p>
<p>them. Facebook stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if</p>
<p>your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our</p>
<p>referral program. Your friend may contact us through the <span style="background-color: green;">H</span><span style="background-color: red;">form on our h</span>elp <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">pag</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nter</span> to request that we remove<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>this</span> <span style="background-color: green;">this</p>
<p></span>information from our database.</p>
<p>Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant</p>
<p>messaging services, and other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g.,</p>
<p>photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the</p>
<p>United States.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or</p>
<p>knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for</p>
<p>Facebook or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number,</p>
<p>or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Facebook. In the</p>
<p>event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without</p>
<p>verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we</p>
<p>might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us through the form on our</p>
<p>privacy help page.</p>
<p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any</p>
<p>information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile</p>
<p>information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in</p>
<p>your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your</p>
<p>name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Facebook that we think</p>
<p>you may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you</p>
<p>access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy</p>
<p>settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook</p>
<p>users may be able to supplement your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one</p>
<p>of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography,</p>
<p>friends of friends). Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search</p>
<p>results across the Facebook network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third</p>
<p>party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who</p>
<p>see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a</p>
<p>relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based</p>
<p>on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of</p>
<p>the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you</p>
<p>may receive an email alerting you to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, you may opt out of such emails from the Notifications page, though Facebook reserves the right</p>
<p>to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do</p>
<p>this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing</p>
<p>advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You</p>
<p>can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be</p>
<p>interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an</p>
<p>advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company</p>
<p>who you are.</p>
<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to</p>
<p>newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers</p>
<p>and other users of Facebook, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally</p>
<p>allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions</p>
<p>that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing</p>
<p>you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose</p>
<p>the information you provide to friends and networks through Facebook. Our network architecture and your</p>
<p>privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not</p>
<p>provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information</p>
<p>with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to</p>
<p>offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p>
<p>Your News Feed and Wall may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your</p>
<p>friends and network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for</p>
<p>your News Feed and Wall on your Privacy Settings page.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search</p>
<p>engine "crawlers" (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these</p>
<p>engines to personal information beyond your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data</p>
<p>about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.</p>
<p>Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-</p>
<p>location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive</p>
<p>information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job</p>
<p>application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection</p>
<p>with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your</p>
<p>personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where</p>
<p>we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable</p>
<p>contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Facebook-specified</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using</p>
<p>the Facebook Platform ("Platform Applications"), those Platform Applications may access and share</p>
<p>certain information about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings. You may opt-</p>
<p>out of any sharing of certain or all information through Platform Applications on the Privacy Settings</p>
<p>page. In addition, third party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications</p>
<p>("Platform Developers"), may also have access to your personal information (excluding your contact</p>
<p>information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any Platform</p>
<p>Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Facebook requires the Platform</p>
<p>Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your</p>
<p>privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of your information. However,</p>
<p>while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such</p>
<p>information by such Platform Developers, we of course cannot and do not guarantee that all</p>
<p>Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that Facebook does not screen or</p>
<p>approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal</p>
<p>information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform</p>
<p>Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other</p>
<p>policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on you, so please</p>
<p>make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any Platform Application. You</p>
<p>can report any suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform and we will</p>
<p>investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Platform Developer up to and</p>
<p>including terminating their participation in the Facebook Platform and/or other formal legal action.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook</p>
<p>world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are</p>
<p>changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or</p>
<p>court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a</p>
<p>good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets</p>
<p>applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we</p>
<p>believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or</p>
<p>other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook name, or to</p>
<p>prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers,</p>
<p>agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through</p>
<p>on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell</p>
<p>when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share</p>
<p>customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when</p>
<p>you make a purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a</p>
<p>Facebook user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites</p>
<p>and potentially shared with your friends on Facebook, we collect certain information from that site</p>
<p>and present it to you after you have completed an action on that site. You have the choice to have</p>
<p>Facebook discard that information, or to share it with your friends.</p>
<p>To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To</p>
<p>opt out of the service altogether, click here.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even</p>
<p>if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in</p>
<p>conjunction with the technical operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives</p>
<p>information on users that are not logged in, or on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to</p>
<p>associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units</p>
<p>owned by Facebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new</p>
<p>owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user</p>
<p>information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone</p>
<p>in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings</p>
<p>or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All</p>
<p>such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal</p>
<p>information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or</p>
<p>other items , this information may become publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Facebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of</p>
<p>other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy</p>
<p>statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy</p>
<p>applies solely to information collected by Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third</p>
<p>party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party</p>
<p>advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and</p>
<p>"web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize</p>
<p>advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they</p>
<p>send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising</p>
<p>content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser</p>
<p>saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access</p>
<p>to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have</p>
<p>no access to your contact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other</p>
<p>tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile</p>
<p>editing tools. Facebook users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging</p>
<p>into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their</p>
<p>Facebook account may do so on the My Account page. Removed information may persist in backup copies</p>
<p>for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Facebook.</p>
<p>Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other</p>
<p>individuals on Facebook, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Facebook user) you</p>
<p>generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is</p>
<p>located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card</p>
<p>number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To</p>
<p>learn more about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because email and instant</p>
<p>messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information</p>
<p>to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of Facebook</p>
<p>Web Site, please contact us through the <span style="background-color: green;">H</span><span style="background-color: red;">form on our privacy h</span>elp <span style="background-color: green;">C</span><span style="background-color: red;">pag</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">nter</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong></p>
<p>Your use of Facebook, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms</p>
<p>of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of</p>
<p>law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material</p>
<p>changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days</p>
<p>of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page</p>
<p>the policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email,</p>
<p>or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that</p>
<p>you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all</p>
<p>information that we have about you and your account.</p>
