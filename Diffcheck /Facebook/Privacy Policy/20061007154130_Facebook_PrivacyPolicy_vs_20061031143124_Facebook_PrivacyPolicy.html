<p><strong>Facebook Principles</strong></p>
<p>We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may</p>
<p>not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you control of your</p>
<p>information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your <span style="background-color: red;">school, your specified local</p>
<p>area, a</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d oth</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">two</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">ks</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and other</p>
<p></span>reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.</p>
<p>Facebook follows two core principles:</p>
<p><strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p>Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in</p>
<p>your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control with</p>
<p>whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the My Privacy page.</p>
<p><strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong><span style="background-color: green;"> </span></p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your</p>
<p>friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p>
<p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with</p>
<p>whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please send them to privacy@facebook.com.</p>

<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you visit Facebook you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to</p>
<p>disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email</p>
<p>address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference</p>
<p>information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Facebook</p>
<p>visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on</p>
<p>the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.</p>
<p>These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID</p>
<p>(but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Facebook. You can remove or block this</p>
<p>cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When you use Facebook, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up</p>
<p>events, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the</p>
<p>service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior</p>
<p>messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the</p>
<p>prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>

<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Facebook is a violation of the Facebook Terms of Service</p>
<p>and should be reported to privacy@facebook.com.</p>
<p></span>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend<span style="background-color: red;">ʼ</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>s email address. We</p>
<p>will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Facebook stores this information</p>
<p>to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our</p>
<p>referral program. Your friend may contact us at info@facebook.com to request that we remove this information from our</p>
<p>database.</p>
<p>Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging</p>
<p>services, and other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide</p>
<p>you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
<p>Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow</p>
<p>such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your</p>
<p>name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information</p>
<p>to or on Facebook. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13</p>
<p>without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might</p>
<p>have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@facebook.com.</p>
<p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about</p>
<p>themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as</p>
<p>your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to</p>
<p>connect with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications</p>
<p>regarding new services offered by Facebook that we think you may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service</p>
<p>and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your</p>
<p>privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the</p>
<p>networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).</p>
<p>Your name, <span style="background-color: red;">school </span>n<span style="background-color: red;">am</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">twork names</span>, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">unless you </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">lter your privacy setti</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search en</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">ine</span>s. This is primarily so your<span style="background-color: red;"> friends at other schools can find you and send a friend</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">friends can find you and send a friend </span>request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access<span style="background-color: red;"> your profile information unless they</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">your profile information unless they </span>have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your <span style="background-color: red;">school's </span>network<span style="background-color: green;">s</span>, etc.) that<span style="background-color: red;"> allows such access based</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">allows such access based </span>on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Facebook will send you only service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the</p>
<p>service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an</p>
<p>email alerting you to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to</p>
<p>receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<p>Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for</p>
<p>purposes such as aggregating how many people <span style="background-color: red;">at</span><span style="background-color: green;">in</span> a <span style="background-color: red;">sch</span><span style="background-color: green;">netw</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ol</span><span style="background-color: green;">rk</span> like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and</p>
<p>promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world</p>
<p>around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a</p>
<p>favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town.</p>
<p>But we don't tell the movie company who you are.</p>
<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and</p>
<p>Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services and other users of Facebook, to supplement your profile. Where</p>
<p>such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or</p>
<p>to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with</p>
<p>controls that restrict other third parties from accessing your information. </span>We <span style="background-color: red;">do not provide cont</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ll</span><span style="background-color: red;">ct inf</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">rmation</span> <span style="background-color: red;">to third part</span>y<span style="background-color: green;">ou</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to choose the infor</span>ma<span style="background-color: green;">tion you</p>

<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third</p>
<p>parties to facilitate our business, </span>such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p></span>business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>personal information, we implement reasonable<span style="background-color: red;"> contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that </span>information to the Facebook-specified purposes.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the use of the Facebook Development Platform, third parties who agree to abide by the</p>
<p>Facebook Development Platform Terms of Service, including restrictions on access, storage and use of such data,</p>
<p>may have limited access to your personal information. We have undertaken contractual and technical steps to</p>
<p>restrict possible misuse of such information by such third parties, but of course cannot and do not guarantee that</p>
<p>all third parties will abide by such agreements. Please report any suspected misuse of information through the</p>
<p>Facebook Development Platform here and we will investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against</p>
<p>the third party. You may opt-out of any sharing of information through the Facebook Development Platform on</p>
<p>the My Privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>page.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such</p>
<p>accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit</p>
<p>possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders,</p>
<p>or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an</p>
<p>information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may</p>
<p>share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or</p>
<p>property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook</p>
<p>name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers,</p>
<p>agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored</p>
<p>groups or other on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another</p>
<p>company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with</p>
<p>that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can</p>
<p>continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the</p>
<p>promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Facebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web</p>
<p>sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web</p>
<p>site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers.</p>
<p>They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to</p>
<p>your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the</p>
<p>effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize</p>
<p>your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to</p>
<p>personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or</p>
<p>browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access to or</p>
<p>control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your</p>
<p>contact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking</p>
<p>technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.</p>
<p>Facebook users may modify or remove any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account.</p>
<p>Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>My</p>
<p>Account<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"> </span>page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally</p>
<p>available to members of Facebook.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p>Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Facebook,</p>
<p>however, (e.g., posting on someone else's Wall) you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Facebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a</p>
<p>secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we</p>
<p>request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions</p>
<p>about the security of Facebook Web Site, please contact us at privacy@facebook.com.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to visit Facebook, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of</p>
<p>Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of, and application of law of the state of California. We reserve the right</p>
<p>to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect</p>
<p>immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will</p>
