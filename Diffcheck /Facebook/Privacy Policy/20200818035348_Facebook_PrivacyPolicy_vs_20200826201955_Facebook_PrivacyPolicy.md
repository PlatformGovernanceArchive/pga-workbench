You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to


share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience <span style="background-color: green;">that </span>you shared with. For


example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot<span style="background-color: green;"> or reshare


that content to others across or off our Products</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">i</span><span style="background-color: red;">or reshare

Also,


when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see


the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.

P</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ople</span> <span style="background-color: red;">c</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">n</span> <span style="background-color: red;">also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For exam</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">le, people


can s</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">are a ph</span>oto of you in a <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>tory, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or


messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the


content.


**Information about your active status or presence on our Products.**


People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently


active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.


**Apps, websites<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> and third-party integrations on or using our Products.**


When you choose to use third-party apps, websites<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can


receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a


Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities


in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such


third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and


websites <span style="background-color: green;">that </span>you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites <span style="background-color: green;">that</span><span style="background-color: red;">you use</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">you use </span>will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your


Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).


Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.


Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our


own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share


with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.


*Note: We are in the process of restricting developers<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span> data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will*


*remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in <span style="background-color: red;">3</span><span style="background-color: green;">three</span> months, and we are*


*changing <span style="background-color: red;">L</span><span style="background-color: green;">l</span>ogin, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only*


*name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.*


**New owner.**


If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new


owner.


**Sharing with <span style="background-color: red;">T</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>hird-<span style="background-color: red;">P</span><span style="background-color: green;">p</span>arty <span style="background-color: red;">P</span><span style="background-color: green;">p</span>artners**


We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow


their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We


don't sell any of your information to anyone<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use<span style="background-color: red;">


and</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and


</span>disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties<span style="background-color: green;"> that</span> we share information with:


**Partners who use our analytics services.**


We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their


posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram


business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to<span style="background-color: red;">,</span> or commented on their


posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or


account.


**Advertisers.**


We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't


share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to


contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and


interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in


Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led



you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.


**Measurement partners.**


We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.


**Partners offering goods and services in our Products.**


When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can


receive your public information and other information <span style="background-color: green;">that </span>you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the


transaction, including shipping and contact details.


**Vendors and service providers.**


We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical


infrastructure services, analy<span style="background-color: red;">z</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting


surveys.


**Researchers and academics.**


We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship


and innovation that support<span style="background-color: red;"> our bu</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">iness</span> o<span style="background-color: green;">u</span>r <span style="background-color: red;">mi</span><span style="background-color: green;">bu</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">s</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">o</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">,</span><span style="background-color: green;">ess or mission</span> and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare,


technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.


**Law enforcement or legal requests.**


We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.


Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the


Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings.


**IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?**


Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and


Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products <span style="background-color: green;">that </span>you use. We also


process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with


their <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">T</span>erms and <span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">P</span>olicies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take


appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact


with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.


**V. How can I manage or delete information about me?**


We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and <span style="background-color: green;">d</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">ras</span><span style="background-color: green;">let</span>e your data. Learn more in your Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings.


We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products<span style="background-color: green;"> or until your account is deleted – whichever


comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">or until your account is deleted - </span>wh<span style="background-color: red;">ichever


comes first. This is a case-b</span>y<span style="background-color: red;">-case</span> <span style="background-color: red;">determ</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">na</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">ion</span> <span style="background-color: red;">that depends on th</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ng</span>s <span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">like the nature </span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ll</span><span style="background-color: red;">f th</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;"> da</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">ed </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">nd processed</span>,<span style="background-color: red;"> why it is collected and processed, and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">and </span>relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete<span style="background-color: red;"> that</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">that </span>query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after <span style="background-color: red;">6</span><span style="background-color: green;">six</span> months. If you submit a copy of your


government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after <span style="background-color: green;">rev</span><span style="background-color: red;">subm</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ssio</span><span style="background-color: green;">ew, u</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">less otherwise stated</span>. Learn more<span style="background-color: red;"> about deletion of content</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">about deletion of content that </span>you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.


When you delete your account, we delete things <span style="background-color: green;">that </span>you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>recover<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>th<span style="background-color: red;">at</span><span style="background-color: green;">is</span> information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want<span style="background-color: red;"> to delete</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to delete </span>your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>any time,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>please visit the Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings and Instagram <span style="background-color: red;">S</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>ettings.


**VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?**


We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:


In response to a legal request (<span style="background-color: red;">lik</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">.g.</span> a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">-</span>faith belief that the law requires us to


do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief


that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction<span style="background-color: green;"> and is consistent with internationally recognised


standards.


When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">and is consistent with inte</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">nationally r</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">cognized

</span>including as part of investigations or regulatory <span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;">e</span>nquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>relevant, we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>fraud, abuse and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>other harmful activity on and off our Products.


Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and


preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation<span style="background-color: green;"> or investigations of


possible violations of our terms or policies</span>, or <span style="background-color: green;">otherw</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">se to pre</span>ve<span style="background-color: red;">stigatio</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span> <span style="background-color: green;">harm.</span><span style="background-color: red;">of

transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> and to globally operate and provide

as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.


**VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?**


We'll notify you before we make changes to this <span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">P</span>olicy and give you the opportunity to review the revised <span style="background-color: red;">p</span><span style="background-color: green;">P</span>olicy before you choose to


continue using our Products.
