**Facebook Principles**


We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not<span style="background-color: red;"> want</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">want </span>everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you control of your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>information. Our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your networks and other reasonable<span style="background-color: red;"> community limitations that</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">community limitations that </span>we tell you about.


Facebook follows two core principles:


**1. You should have control over your personal information.** 


Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>profile,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control the users with<span style="background-color: red;"> whom you share</span>


<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">w</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">at inf</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">r</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ation</span> <span style="background-color: red;">through the privac</span>y<span style="background-color: red;"> settings </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">u</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span>h<span style="background-color: green;">ar</span>e <span style="background-color: red;">M</span><span style="background-color: green;">that information through the privac</span>y<span style="background-color: green;"> settings on the</span> Privacy page.


**2. You should have access to the information others want to share.** 


There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>friends, and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.


Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with<span style="background-color: red;"> whom you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">whom you </span>share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please send them to privacy@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>.

</span>invitation,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

<span style="background-color: red;">
</span><span style="background-color: green;">and </span>other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with<span style="background-color: red;"> more useful</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">more useful </span>information and a more personalized experience.


By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.


**Children Under Age 13**


Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such<span style="background-color: red;"> persons</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">persons </span>to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Facebook or send any information about<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>yourself to us,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any<span style="background-color: red;"> personal information to or</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">personal information to or </span>on Facebook. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>under age 13 without verification of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe<span style="background-color: red;"> that we might have any information from or</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">that we might have any information from or </span>about a child under 13, please contact us at info@facebook.com<span style="background-color: green;"> </span>.


**Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18**


We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about<span style="background-color: red;"> themselves to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">themselves to </span>anyone over the Internet.


**Use of Information Obtained by Facebook**


When you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>name,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect<span style="background-color: red;"> with people on</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">with people on </span>Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new<span style="background-color: red;"> services offered by</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">services offered by </span>Facebook that we think you may find valuable.


Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and<span style="background-color: red;"> to be</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to be </span>presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> settings permit it</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">settings permit it </span>(e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement your profile.


Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the networks<span style="background-color: red;"> you allow</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">you allow </span>to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends). Your name,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>network names, and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network and those limited<span style="background-color: red;"> pieces of information may be</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">pieces of information may be </span>made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>send a friend request. People who see<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>unless they have a relationship to you (friend,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>on your privacy settings.


Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>instance,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an email alerting you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>to that fact.


Generally, you may opt out of such emails <span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;">he</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">om the Notifications pag</span>e, though Facebook reserves the right to send you<span style="background-color: red;"> notices about your account even if</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">notices about your account even if </span>you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.


Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes<span style="background-color: red;"> such as</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">such as </span>aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so<span style="background-color: red;"> that we can</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">that we can </span>provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where<span style="background-color: red;"> there are</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">there are </span>advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile,<span style="background-color: red;"> we might serve</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">we might serve </span>you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we don't tell the movie<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>company who you are.


We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet<span style="background-color: red;"> sources</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">sources </span>such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers and other users of Facebook, to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>supplement your profile.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you<span style="background-color: red;"> do not want this to be done or to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">do not want this to be done or to </span>take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">



</span>photo tag links).


**Sharing Your Information with Third Parties**


Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> settings</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">settings </span>that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>friends and networks<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>through Facebook. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed<span style="background-color: red;"> choices about who has access to</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">choices about who has access to </span>your information. We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your permission. We share your information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1)<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:


Your <span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">N</span>ews <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed and <span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">M</span>ini-<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>network<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your <span style="background-color: red;">n</span><span style="background-color: green;">N</span>ews <span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">F</span>eed and <span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">M</span>ini-<span style="background-color: red;">f</span><span style="background-color: green;">

Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine "crawlers" (e.g.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Google,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal information beyond<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your name, profile<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).


We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use<span style="background-color: red;"> third</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">third </span>parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out<span style="background-color: red;"> email updates</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">email updates </span>about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>or services, to offer<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links).<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>In connection with these<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal<span style="background-color: red;"> information for use for a limited</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">information for use for a limited </span>time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>processing of any personal information,<span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use of that information to the Facebook-specified<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>purposes.


If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using the Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>("Platform Applications"), those Platform Applications may access and share certain information about you<span style="background-color: red;"> with others in</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">with others in </span>accordance with your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>through Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Applications on the Privacy Settings page. In addition, third party developers who have created and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>operate Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Applications ("Platform Developers"), may also have access to your personal information (excluding<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your contact information)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any Platform<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Developer to make any Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Application available to you, Facebook requires the Platform Developer to enter into<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>an agreement which, among other<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>collection, use, and storage of your information.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps<span style="background-color: red;"> to restrict possible misuse of such information by such</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">to restrict possible misuse of such information by such </span>Platform Developers, we of course cannot and do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or<span style="background-color: red;"> in</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">in </span>compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

<span style="background-color: green;">prevent fraud or other illegal </span>activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook name, or to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>government agencies.


We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>or other<span style="background-color: green;"> on-site offers.


We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another


company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with that


company in connection with your use of that store or service.


Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a


purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear


disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on


Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on


that site. You have the choice to have Facebook discard that information, or to share it with your friends.


To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the


service altogether, click here.


Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are logged


out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical


operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-


Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.


If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by Facebook,


Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue


operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in


any pre-existing Privacy Policy.


When you use Facebook, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network),


such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, Marketplace listings or other information, may be shared


with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk.</span>

Facebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>We<span style="background-color: red;">

**Third Party Advertising**


Advertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>They<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>your computer,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the<span style="background-color: red;"> effectiveness of their ads</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">effectiveness of their ads </span>and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your<span style="background-color: red;"> computer each time they send you</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">computer each time they send you </span>an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>advertising content. In this way, they may<span style="background-color: red;">


compile</span> <span style="background-color: red;">information about where individuals using your </span>comp<span style="background-color: red;">uter or browser saw the</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">r adv</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rtisements</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and determ</span>in<span style="background-color: red;">e wh</span><span style="background-color: green;">format</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">on about w</span>h<span style="background-color: green;">ere individuals using your computer or browser saw</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">their advertisements and determine which </span>advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access to or control of the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>cookies that may be placed by the third party<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>them.


This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking<span style="background-color: red;"> technologies by any</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">technologies by any </span>of its advertisers.


**Changing or Removing Information**


Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools. Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> users</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">users </span>may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be<span style="background-color: red;"> updated</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">updated </span>immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the My Account page.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>Removed information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>members of Facebook.


Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Facebook,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>however,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>(e.g., sending a personal message to another Facebook user) you generally cannot remove such communications.


**Security**


Facebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured<span style="background-color: red;"> server</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">server </span>behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt<span style="background-color: red;"> that information</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">that information </span>using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure\_Sockets\_Layer).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>communications, we request that you not send private information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
