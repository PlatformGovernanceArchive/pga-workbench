We are passionate about creating engaging and customized experiences for people. We use all of the information we have to help us provide and support our Services.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

<span style="background-color: green;">how you </span>use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to and interested in on and off our Services.


We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>friend's<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">


</span>pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can<span style="background-color: red;"> control whether we</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">control whether we </span>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and Tagging” settings.

<span style="background-color: green;">friends that </span>you are nearby.

<span style="background-color: green;">and </span>terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.

Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you:
