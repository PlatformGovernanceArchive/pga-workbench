<p><strong>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about you. The type of information that we collect depends on how you use</p>
<p>our Products. You can learn how to access and delete information we collect by visiting the Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>
<p><strong>Things that you and others do and provide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and content you provide.</strong> We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when</p>
<p>you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content and message or communicate</p>
<p>with others. This can include information in or about the content that you provide (e.g. metadata), such as the location of a</p>
<p>photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features that we provide, such as our camera,</p>
<p>so we can do things such as suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using <span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">portr</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">it </span>m<span style="background-color: red;">od</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ra formats</span>. Our</p>

<p>them for the purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>
<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Facebook profile fields or life events</p>
<p>about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in" or your health. This and other information (such</p>
<p>as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) <span style="background-color: red;">is</span><span style="background-color: green;">could be</span> subject to special protections<span style="background-color: red;"> under EU</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">under the </span>law<span style="background-color: green;">s of your country</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups that you</p>
<p>are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or</p>
<p>groups that you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device</p>
<p>(such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things such as helping you and others find</p>
<p>people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content that you view or engage</p>
<p>with, the features you use, the actions you take, the people or accounts you interact with and the time, frequency and</p>
<p>duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos</p>
<p>and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you use features such as our camera.</p>
<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our Products for purchases or other financial</p>
<p>transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information about the</p>
<p>purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card</p>
<p>information, other account and authentication information, and billing, delivery and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Things others do and information that they provide about you.</strong> We also receive and analyse content,</p>
<p>communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include information about</p>
<p>you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you or upload, sync or import your</p>
<p>contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Device information.</strong></p>
<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected</p>
<p>devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For</p>
<p>example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalise the content (including</p>
<p>ads) or features that you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether</p>
<p>you took an action in response to an ad that we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal</p>

<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is</p>
<p>foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</p>
<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts that you use, and</p>

<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use</p>
<p>cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information from partners.</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers, app developers and publishers can send us information through Facebook Business Tools that they use, including</p>
<p>our social plugins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel. These partners</p>
<p>provide information about your activities off Facebook – including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases</p>
<p>you make, the ads you see and how you use their services – whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in to</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a</p>
<p>purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party</p>
<p>data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties that they work with. We require each of</p>
<p>these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing us with any data. Learn more about the</p>
<p>types of partners we receive data from.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookie Policy and</p>
<p>Instagram Cookie Policy.</p>
<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the information that we have (subject to choices you make) as described below, and to provide and support the Facebook Products</p>
<p>and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, personalise and improve our Products.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalise features and content (including your News</p>
<p>Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events that you may be</p>
<p>interested in or topics that you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalised Products that are unique and</p>
<p>relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data that we collect and learn from</p>
<p>you and others (including any data with special protections <span style="background-color: red;">that </span>you choose to provide<span style="background-color: red;"> where you have given your explicit</p>
<p>consent</span>); how you use and interact with our Products;<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and the people, places or things that you're connected to and interested in<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>on and off our Products. Learn more about how we<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>use information about you to personalise your Facebook and Instagram<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>experience, including features, content and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>recommendations in Facebook Products; you can also learn more about how we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>choose the ads that you see.</p>
<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on different</p>
<p>Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products that you</p>
<p>use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for</p>
<p>example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product</p>
<p>when you sign up for an account on a different Product.</p>
<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information – such as your current location, where you live, the</p>
<p>places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near – to provide, personalise and improve our Products,</p>
<p>including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things such as precise device location (if</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses and information from your and others' use of Facebook Products (such as</p>
<p>check-ins or events you attend).<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products,</p>
<p>including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>
<p><strong>Face recognition:</strong> If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognise you in photos, videos and</p>
<p>camera experiences. The face recognition templates that we create <span style="background-color: green;">m</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">re</span> <span style="background-color: red;">data with spe</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ial pr</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">tectio</span>ns<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">tit</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;">nd</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">EU l</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">ta </span>w<span style="background-color: green;">ith special protections under the</p>
<p>laws of your country</span>. Learn<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>more about how we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Facebook settings. If we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>introduce face recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you will have control over<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>whether we use this technology for you.</p>
<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you – including information about your</p>
<p>interests, actions and connections – to select and personalise ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you.</p>
<p>Learn more about how we select and personalise ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other</p>
<p>sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Provide measurement, analytics and other business services.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help</p>
<p>advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of</p>
<p>people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps and services. Learn how we share information</p>
<p>with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other</p>
<p>bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Centre and Instagram Security Tips.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let</p>
<p>you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Research and innovate for social good.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and</p>
<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. For example,</p>
<p>we analyse information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research</p>
<p>programmes.</p>
<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts that you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you</p>
<p>post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customised list of</p>
<p>people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and</p>
<p>businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your</p>
<p>Instagram username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<p>You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information</p>
<p>can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs and offline</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">
</span>media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content that others share or reshare about you.</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to</p>
<p>share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For</p>
<p>example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare</p>
<p>that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see</p>
<p>the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people</p>
<p>can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or</p>
<p>messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently</p>
<p>active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can</p>
<p>receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a</p>
<p>Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities</p>
<p>in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and</p>
<p>websites that you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that</p>
<p>you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your</p>
<p>Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our</p>
<p>own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share</p>
<p>with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will</em></p>
<p><em>remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are</em></p>
<p><em>changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new</p>
<p>owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with third-party partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow</p>
<p>their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We</p>
<p>don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and</p>
<p>disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their</p>
<p>posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram</p>
<p>business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their</p>
<p>posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to</p>
<p><span style="background-color: red;">
</span>contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and</p>
<p>interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in<span style="background-color: green;">
</span></p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led</p>
<p>you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can</p>
<p>receive your public information and other information that you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the</p>
<p>transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting</p>
<p>surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship</p>
<p>and innovation that supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare,</p>
<p>technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the</p>
<p>Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and</p>
<p>Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you use. We also</p>
<p>process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with</p>
<p>their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take</p>
<p>appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact</p>
<p>with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
