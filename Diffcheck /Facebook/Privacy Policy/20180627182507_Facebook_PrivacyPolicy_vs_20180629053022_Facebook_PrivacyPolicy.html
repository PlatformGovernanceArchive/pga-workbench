<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you</p>
<p>post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of</p>
<p>people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and</p>
<p>businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your</p>
<p>Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on Facebook; and</p>
<p>content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<p>You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off</p>
<p>our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information</p>
<p>can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline</p>
<p>media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>
<p>Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to</p>
<p>share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For</p>
<p>example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare</p>
<p>that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see</p>
<p>the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people</p>
<p>can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or</p>
<p>messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Product</span>s.</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently</p>
<p>active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can</p>
<p>receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a</p>
<p>Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities</p>
<p>in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and</p>
<p>websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use</p>
<p>will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your</p>
<p>Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our</p>
<p>own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share</p>
<p>with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will</em></p>
<p><em>remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are</em></p>
<p><em>changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new</p>
<p>owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow</p>
<p>their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We</p>
<p>don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use</p>
<p>and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:</p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their</p>
<p>posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram</p>
<p>business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their</p>
<p>posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to</p>
<p>contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and</p>
<p>interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led</p>
<p>you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can</p>
<p>receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the</p>
<p>transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting</p>
<p>surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers and academics.</strong></p>
<p>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship</p>
<p>and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare,</p>
<p>technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests</strong></p>
<p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</p>

<p>—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us</p>
<p>what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you</p>
<p>made in its store. We also receive information about your online and</p>
<p>offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have</p>

<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through</p>

<p>How do we use this information?</p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and</p>
<p>to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: green;">V</span><span style="background-color: red;">Provide, personalize and improve our Products</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> How can I manage information about me?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever</p>
<p>comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and</p>
<p>relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that</p>
<p>query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your</p>
<p>government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content</p>
<p>you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover</p>
<p>that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete</p>
<p>your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time,</p>
<p>please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>

<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>

<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use</p>
<p>may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with</p>
<p>them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers</p>
<p>may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own</p>
<p>terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>

<p>our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we</p>
<p>will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>
<p>address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't</p>
<p>sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the</p>
<p>types of third parties we share information with: </p>

<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing</p>
<p>their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you (information such as your</p>
<p>name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or</p>
<p>identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34</p>
<p>who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you</p>
<p>to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>

<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>

<p>its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>How can I manage or delete information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete</p>
<p>that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have</p>
<p>shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos</p>
<p>and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information</p>
<p>that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you</p>
<p>don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you</p>
<p>can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>

<p>How do we respond to legal requests or</p>
<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if</p>
<p>we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or</p>

<p>purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period</p>
<p>when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or</p>
<p>investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent</p>
<p>harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least</p>
<p>a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>

<p>in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>

<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
