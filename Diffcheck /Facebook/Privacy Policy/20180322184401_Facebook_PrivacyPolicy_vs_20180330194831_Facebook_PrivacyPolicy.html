<p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the</p>
<p>audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on</p>
<p>Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a customized</p>

<p>or message. </p>
<p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience,</p>
<p>as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a</p>
<p>Facebook Page or another public forum. Public information is available to</p>
<p>anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through online</p>
<p>search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on TV. </p>
<p>In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download</p>
<p>or re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you</p>
<p>comment on another person’s post or like their content on Facebook,</p>
<p>that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If</p>
<p>their audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>

<p>activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from</p>

<p><strong>Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or</p>
<p>who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our</p>

<p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other</p>
<p>information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the</p>
<p>information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable</p>
<p>information is information like name or email address that can by itself</p>
<p>be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising,</p>
<p>measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We</p>
<p>may provide these partners with information about the reach and</p>
<p>effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that</p>
<p>it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser</p>
<p>how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed</p>
<p>an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying</p>
<p>demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who</p>
<p>likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand</p>
<p>their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to</p>
<p>abide by our advertiser guidelines. </p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re</p>
<p>seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences if</p>
<p>you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners.</strong></p>
<p>We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners</p>
<p>who globally support our business, such as providing technical</p>
<p>infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring</p>
<p>the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service,</p>
<p>facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys.</p>
<p>These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way</p>
<p>that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements we enter into</p>
<p>with them.</p>

<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a</p>
<p>search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions</p>
<p>outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is</p>
<p>required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent</p>
<p>with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share</p>
<p>information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and</p>
<p>address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as</p>
<p>part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may</p>
<p>provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to</p>
<p>prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our Services. Information we receive about you,</p>
<p>including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook, may be</p>

<p>a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may</p>
