We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Facebook works. You should read this policy in its


entirety, but should pay particular attention to these three highlights: 


**Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want.**


**You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing on Facebook and you control**


**how it is distributed through your** **privacy settings****. You should review the default** **privacy**


**settings** **and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences. You should also consider**


**your settings whenever you share information.** 


**Facebook is not just a website. It is also a service for sharing your information on Facebook-**


**enhanced applications and websites. You can control how you share information with those**


**third-party applications and websites through your** **application settings** **and you can learn more**


**about how information is shared with them on our** **About Platform** **page. You can also limit how**


**your friends share your information with applications through your** **privacy settings****.**


**Facebook is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your**


**information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to select**


**characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to and we use the information**


**we have collected to serve those advertisements.**


This policy contains eight sections:


**1. Introduction**


**2. Information We Receive** 


**3. Information You Share With Third Parties**


**4. How We Use Your Information**


**5. How We Share Information**


**6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information**


**7. How We Protect Information</span>8.<span style="background-color: red;">


**Facebook Principles**


We built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand


you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you


control of your information.</span> O<span style="background-color: red;">ur defaul</span>t<span style="background-color: red;"> privacy settings limit t</span>he<span style="background-color: red;"> info</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">mation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">T</span><span style="background-color: red;">display</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">d in you</span>r<span style="background-color: red;"> profile to your

</span>**<span style="background-color: red;">2. You should have access to the information others want to share.** 


There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you,


your friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.


Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how


and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please check out our privacy help page.

<span style="background-color: red;">When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all


Facebook visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of


data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that


users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent


cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to


Facebook. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this

When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform


searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various


channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In


most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see


your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable


period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage


parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children


about safe internet use can be found on this help page.


**2. Information We Receive**


**Information you provide to us:**


**Personal information.** When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth


date. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to provide additional profile information, such as


where you went to school and where you work, and to add a picture of yourself, to help your friends connect with


you. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you.


Once you register you can visit your profile at any time to add or remove personal information about yourself. You


can add basic information about yourself, such as information about your hometown, family, relationships, and your


political and religious views. You can also add other information about yourself including your activities, interests,


contact information, as well as more information about your education and job history.

**Content.** One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when


you update your status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link, create an event or a group,


make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want


us to store metadata associated with content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the


metadata before uploading the content. 


**Transactional Information.** We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook.


However, we will only keep your payment source account number with your consent.


**Friend Information.** We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can


find your friends on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have Facebook accounts to join. If you do not


want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we


will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts’ information.


**Location Information.** When you share your location with others or add a location to something you post, we


treat that like any other content you post (for example, it is subject to your privacy settings). If we offer a service


that supports this type of location sharing we will present you with an opt-in choice of whether you want to


participate.


**Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:**


**Site activity information.** We keep track of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding a friend, becoming


a fan of a Facebook Page, joining a group or an event, creating a photo album, sending a gift, poking another user,


indicating you “like” a post, attending an event, or authorizing an application. In some cases you are also taking an


action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the


actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact you shared it. 


**Access Device and Browser Information.** When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or


other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as


well as the pages you visit.


**Cookie Information.** We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your


computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to


protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to


make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are


logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our


widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your


browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook. 


**Information we receive from third parties:**


**Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect.** We do not own or operate the applications that you use through


Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities) or the websites that you interact with through Facebook Connect.


We refer to them as “Facebook-enhanced” applications and websites because they use our Platform to provide you


with social features. Whenever you authorize a Facebook-enhanced application or website, we will receive


information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the


process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you authorize the application or


website. 


**Information from other websites.** We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in


which they share information with us: 


- We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison


purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as


“conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements


you see.


- We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in


order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.

**Information from other users.** We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when


a friend tags you in a photo or video, provides friend details, or indicates a relationship with you. You can limit who


can see that you have been tagged in a photo or video – which we refer to as photos or videos “of me” – in your


privacy settings.

**“Everyone” Privacy Setting.** Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, may be accessed by


everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into</span> Faceboo<span style="background-color: red;">k users may be able to supplement


your profile.


Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the


networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of


friends). Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the


Facebook network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This


is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however,


will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend,


member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.


Facebook may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the


service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive


an email alerting you to that fact.


Generally, you may opt out of such emails from the Notifications page, though Facebook reserves the right to send


you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.


Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for


purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements


and promotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the


world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if


you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar


one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company who you are.


We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and


Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Facebook Platform developers and other users of


Facebook, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your


privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this


information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).


**Sharing Your Information with Third Parties**


Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with


privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information


you provide to friends and networks through Facebook. Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow


you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not provide contact information to


third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited


circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or,


3) permitted by you. For example:


Your News Feed and Wall may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and


network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your News Feed and Wall on


your Privacy Settings page.


Unlike most sites on the Web, Facebook limits access to site information by third party search engine "crawlers" (e.g.


Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Facebook takes action to block access by these engines to personal information beyond



your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of wall postings).


We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use


third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out


email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for


products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including


sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access


to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize


third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical


protections limiting the use of that information to the Facebook-specified purposes.


If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed using the Facebook


Platform ("Platform Applications"), those Platform Applications may access and share certain information about you


with others in accordance with your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information


through Platform Applications on the Privacy Settings page. In addition, third party developers who have created


and operate Platform Applications ("Platform Developers"), may also have access to your personal information


(excluding your contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any


Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Facebook requires the Platform Developer to


enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits


their collection, use, and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical


steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we of course cannot and do not


guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that Facebook does not screen or


approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal information that


they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform Developers may require you to sign


up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose


additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any


Platform Application. You can report any suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform and we will


investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Platform Developer up to and including


terminating their participation in the Facebook Platform and/or other formal legal action.


We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such


accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit


possible misuse.


We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or


in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information


request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account


or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to


prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook name, or to


prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or


government agencies.


We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.


We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another


company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with that


company in connection with your use of that store or service.


Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make a


purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear


disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on


Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on


that site. You have the choice to have Facebook discard that information, or to share it with your friends.


To learn more about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the


service altogether, click here.


Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if you are


logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical


operation of the system. In cases where Facebook receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-


Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook accounts and will discard it.


If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by Facebook,


Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue


operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in


any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

networ</span>k), <span style="background-color: red;">such as personal </span>i<span style="background-color: red;">nforma</span><span style="background-color: green;">s subjec</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;"> t</span>o<span style="background-color: green;"> i</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">dexing by third party search

Prior to allowing them to


access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their use of your information (which


you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to


ensure that they only obtain authorized information. We also give you tools to control how your information is


shared with them:


- You can choose to opt-out of Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect altogether through your privacy settings 


- You can block specific applications from accessing your information by visiting your application settings or the


application’s “</span>A<span style="background-color: green;">bou</span><span style="background-color: red;">dver</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">isin</span><span style="background-color: green;">” pa</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">e</span><span style="background-color: red;">**</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">- You can use your privacy settings to limit which of your information is available to “everyone” (by default, every


application and website, including those you have not connected with, can access “everyone” and other publicly


available content) 


- You can use your application settings to limit which of your information your friends can make available to


applications and websites


- We may make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to


Facebook –enhanced applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and


control the distribution of age-appropriate content. 


You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with


the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If


you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this help page and


we will take action as necessary.


**Exporting Information.** You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds,


mobile phone address books, or copy and paste functions, to capture and export information from Facebook,


including your information and information about you.

**4. How We Use Your Information**


We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of


the details on how we do that:


**To manage the service.** We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to


measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the


information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. For


example, we ask for your date of birth to verify that you are over age 13 and so that we can better limit your


access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. We also use a variety of technological systems


to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on


occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.


**To contact you.** We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of


all communications except essential updates on your account notifications page. We may include content you see on


Facebook in the emails we send to you.


**To serve personalized advertising to you.** We don’t share your information with advertisers without your


consent.</span> (<span style="background-color: red;">or</span><span style="background-color: green;">An</span> <span style="background-color: red;">"s</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">rv</span><span style="background-color: green;">xampl</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> of consent woul</span>d<span style="background-color: red;">"</span><span style="background-color: green;"> be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser to

</span>advertiser<span style="background-color: green;">s to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements


and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may


have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or


preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisement</span>s. <span style="background-color: green;">For example, we might use your interest


in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment company who you are. You


can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your


information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement


there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they


selected.

and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends. For example, if


you become a fan of a Page, we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that Page


that is displayed to your friends. We only share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the


friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help page.


**To supplement your profile.** We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to


supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update).</span> I<span style="background-color: red;">P address whe</span>n <span style="background-color: red;">thi</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> happens.

clicked. Facebook does not have access to or control of the cookies that ma</span>y <span style="background-color: red;">be placed by the third party


advertisers. Third party advertisers have n</span>o<span style="background-color: red;"> access to your co</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">tact information stored on Facebook unless you


choose to share it with them.


This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking


technologies by any of its advertisers.


**Changing or Removing Information**



Access and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.


Facebook users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account.


Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on


the My Account page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not


be generally available to members of</span> Facebook.


<span style="background-color: green;">**To make Suggestions.** </span>W<span style="background-color: red;">h</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">re</span> <span style="background-color: red;">yo</span>u<span style="background-color: green;">se your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers,


and other relevant information, to help you connect with your friends, including</span> mak<span style="background-color: red;">e use of the commun</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">catio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">g</span> <span style="background-color: red;">feature</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> of the service to share information with other individ</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">al</span><span style="background-color: green;">gge</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">ti</span>on<span style="background-color: green;">s to you and</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">other users that you connect with on Facebook. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other


people, you can adjust your search visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the


extent you choose to be visible in public search listings. You may also block specific individual users from being


suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.


**Downloadable Software.** Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our


browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our


collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive


photos when you use our photo uploader. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such


information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide


whether you want to use that feature.


**Memorializing Accounts.** If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In


such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to write on the user’s Wall in


remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user’s next of kin or other proper


legal request to do so.


**5. How We Share Information**


Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with



privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information


with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or


when legally required to do so. For example:


**When you make a payment.** When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on </span>Facebook, <span style="background-color: red;">ho</span>we<span style="background-color: red;">ve</span><span style="background-color: green;">


will only sha</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">e transaction information with those third parties necessary to complete the transaction and will require


those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information. 


**When you invite a friend to join.** When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">we will send your friend a


message on your behalf using your name. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If your


friend does not want us to keep their information, we will remove it at their request on this help page.


**When you choose to share your information with marketers.** You may choose to share information with


marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Facebook through on-site offers. This is


entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.


**To help your friends find you.** By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available


in search results on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can control who has access to this


information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and


instant messaging providers to help their users identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can


promote Facebook to those users. 


**To give search engines access to publicly available information.** We generally limit search engines’ access


to our site. We may allow them to access information set to the “everyone” setting and your public search listing


</span>(<span style="background-color: green;">but you can turn off your public s</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">arch listing in your privacy settings)</span>.<span style="background-color: red;">g</span><span style="background-color: green;"> 


**To help improve or promote our service</span>.<span style="background-color: green;">** Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to


help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or


linked to any specific action or information.


**To provide you with services.** We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the


services we offer. For example</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">w</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">nding</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a personal </span>m<span style="background-color: red;">ess</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">y</span><span style="background-color: red;">ge</span> <span style="background-color: green;">us</span><span style="background-color: red;">to anoth</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: green;">third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about


</span>Facebook<span style="background-color: green;">,</span> <span style="background-color: red;">use</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">emove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links


(including sponsored links</span>)<span style="background-color: red;"> you generally cannot remove


such communications</span>.<span style="background-color: green;"> These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of


that information to helping us provide the service.


</span>**<span style="background-color: green;">To advertise our services.** We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services.


We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other


information with the advertiser.


**To offer joint services.** We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in


the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service.


However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you use


that service.


**To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.** We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court


orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is


required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United </span>S<span style="background-color: red;">ecuri</span>t<span style="background-color: red;">y**</span><span style="background-color: green;">ates where we have</span>


<span style="background-color: green;">a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from


that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information


when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily


harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may


include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.


**</span>Facebook <span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">Be</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">con.** [We have announced a settlement of a lawsuit related to the Beacon product: the Beacon


product will be discontinued and this language removed from the privacy policy upon approval of a settlement by the


court.] Faceboo</span>k<span style="background-color: red;">es</span> <span style="background-color: green;">B</span><span style="background-color: red;">appropriat</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> prec</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">utions to prote</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">t </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ur users' i</span>n<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">format</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">o</span><span style="background-color: green;">s a mea</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">s of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make


a purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear


disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on


Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on


that site. </span>You<span style="background-color: red;">r</span> <span style="background-color: red;">account information is located on a


secured server be</span>h<span style="background-color: red;">ind </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">v</span><span style="background-color: red;"> fir</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">w</span><span style="background-color: green;"> the choice to h</span>a<span style="background-color: red;">ll</span><span style="background-color: green;">ve us discard that information, or to share it with your friends</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">To learn more


about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the service


altogether, click here. Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some


information even if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in


conjunction with the technical operation of the system. In cases where we receive information from Beacon sites on


users that are not logged in, or on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook


accounts and will discard it.


**Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.** If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business


changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a


case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.


**6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information**


**Viewing and editing your profile.** You may change or delete your profile information at any time by going to


your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately. </span>Wh<span style="background-color: red;">en you enter sens</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">tiv</span>e <span style="background-color: green;">you cannot delete


your date of birth, you can use the setting on the info tab of your profile information page to hide all or part of it


from other users.


**Delete uploaded contacts.** If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on


this help page.


**Deactivating or deleting your account.** If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete


it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile


</span>information (<span style="background-color: green;">f</span><span style="background-color: red;">such as c</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ed</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">t card numb</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">r or your


passwor</span>d<span style="background-color: green;">s, photos, interests, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users


deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they


return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety.


When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete your account if you are certain you


never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account settings page or delete your account


on this help page.


**Limitations on removal.** Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of


that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise


distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no


longer be associated with that information on Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another user’s


profile, and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook


User.”) Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if


deletion has been requested.


**Backup copies.** Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be


available to others. 


**Non-user contact information.** If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user


but you want us to delete your address, you can do so on this help page. However, that request will only apply to


addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later. 


**7. How We Protect Information** 


We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about



staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.


**Steps we take to keep your information secure.** We keep your account information on a secured server


behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords</span>), we encrypt<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">


</span>that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). <span style="background-color: red;">(</span><span style="background-color: green;">We also use automated and social measures to


enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use


of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content,


and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.


**Risks inherent in sharing information.** Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your


information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions


of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view


your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We


are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Facebook. You can


reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different


passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software. 


**Report Violations.** You should report any security violations to us on this help page.

Center.
