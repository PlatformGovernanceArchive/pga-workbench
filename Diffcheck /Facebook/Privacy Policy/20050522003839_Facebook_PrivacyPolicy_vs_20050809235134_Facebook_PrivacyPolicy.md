Because we want to


demonstrate our commitment to our users' privac</span>y<span style="background-color: green;"> is effective as of June 28</span>,<span style="background-color: red;"> we will disclose our information and


privacy practices below. 


 


About Thefacebook and the Information We Collect


 


Thefacebook is an online directory and social networking community that helps people find


friends and other people. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles and


privacy settings, and some personal information we ask for is displayed to people in the


groups specified in the users' privacy settings. 


 


Information Collected by Thefacebook


 


Thefacebook collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address


to identify users and send notifications related to use of the site. Thefacebook also collects


user-submitted profile information such as gender, field, location, courses, etc.


Thefacebook also collects information that is not personally identifiable and not submitted


directly by users, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all


users to the site.


Thefacebook collects information from other sources, such as newspapers and instant


messaging services. This information is gathered regardless of use of the site. 


 


Use of Information Obtained by Thefacebook


 


Profile information, as well as name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the groups


specified in a user's privacy settings to support the function of the site. Except when


inviting a friend to join the site, a user's name and email will never be given to anyone


outside the site. No information submitted to Thefacebook will be available to any user of


the site who does not belong to at least one of the groups specified in a user's privacy


settings.


We use server, IP and browser type for site administration. We also use information not


directly submitted to Thefacebook by users to supplement users' profiles unless they


specify that they do not want this done in their privacy settings. 


 


Spam Policy


 


Email addresses will never be sold to anyone, and they will not be used for spam or any


other purpose outside of the site itself. 


 


Links


 


This site may contain links to other websites. Thefacebook is not responsible for the privacy


practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our


site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally


identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by


this web site. 


 


Use of Cookies


 


A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the


user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies


terminate once the users close the browser. We do not and will not use cookies to collect


private information from any user. 


 


Third Party Advertising


 


Advertisements that appear on this web site are delivered to users by our advertising


partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows the advertising


network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In this


way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your


computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This


information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they


believe will be of most interest to you. Thefacebook does not have access to or control of


the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertising servers of ad networks.


This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Thefacebook and does not cover the


use of cookies by any of its advertisers. 


 


Changing or Removing Information


 



Thefacebook users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by


logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately and old information will


never be displayed to any user of the site. 


 


Security


 


Thefacebook accounts are password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to


protect our users' information. Passwords are stored in hashed form in our database, and


different sections of users' profiles are stored in different parts of our database to


separate access to all of the information and make it more difficult to piece everything


together. If you have any questions about the security of our web site, please contact us. 


 


Changes in Our Privacy Policy


 


We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, we will post


the changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect,


how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use


users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time


of collection, we will notify users via email. 


 


Contacting the Web Site


 


If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your


dealings with this web site, please contact us.

Sharing Your Information with Third Parties


 


We may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with


which we have a relationship. For example:


 • We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we


offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to send

with these business activities.


 • We may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests,


such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.


Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is


necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include


sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.


 • If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Thefacebook business were to
