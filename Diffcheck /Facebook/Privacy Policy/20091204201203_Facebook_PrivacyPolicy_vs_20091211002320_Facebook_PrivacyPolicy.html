<p><strong>Facebook’s Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>Date of last revision: <span style="background-color: green;">D</span><span style="background-color: red;">Nov</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">c</span><span style="background-color: red;">mb</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">mbe</span>r <span style="background-color: red;">1</span>9, 2009.</p>
<p>We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Facebook works. You should read this policy in its</p>
<p>entirety, but should pay particular attention to these <span style="background-color: red;">th</span><span style="background-color: green;">fou</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ee</span> highlights: </p>
<p><strong>Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing on Facebook and you control</strong></p>
<p><strong>how it is distributed through your</strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>. You should review the default</strong> <strong>privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>settings</strong> <strong>and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences. You should also consider</strong></p>
<p><strong>your settings whenever you share information.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Facebook is not just a website. It is also a service for sharing your information on Facebook-</strong></p>
<p><strong>enhanced applications and websites. You can control how you share information with those</strong></p>
<p><strong>third-party applications and websites through your</strong> <strong>application settings</strong> <strong>and you can learn more</strong></p>
<p><strong>about how information is shared with them on our</strong> <strong>About Platform</strong> <strong>page. You can also limit how</strong></p>
<p><strong>your friends share your information with applications through your<span style="background-color: green;"></strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Certain categories of information such as your name, profile photo, list of friends and pages you</strong></p>
<p><strong>are a fan of, gender, geographic region, and networks you belong to are considered publicly</strong></p>
<p><strong>available to everyone, including Facebook-enhanced applications, and therefore do not have</strong></p>
<p><strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>. You can, however, limit the ability of others to find this information through</strong></p>
<p><strong>search using your search</span></strong> <strong>privacy settings</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your</strong></p>
<p><strong>information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to select</strong></p>
<p><strong>characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to and we use the information</strong></p>
<p><strong>we have collected to serve those advertisements.</strong></p>
<p>This policy contains eight sections, and you can jump to each by selecting the links below:</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions.</strong> If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, contact our privacy team through this</p>
<p>help page. You may also contact us by mail at 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304.</p>
<p><strong>TRUSTe Program.</strong> Facebook is a certified licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. This means that our</p>
<p>privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe, an independent organization focused on reviewing</p>
<p>privacy and security policies and practices, for compliance with its strict program requirements. This privacy policy</p>
<p>covers the website www.facebook.com. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this</p>
<p>Web site, and does not cover other information, such as information that may be collected through software</p>
<p>downloaded from Facebook.</p>
<p>If you have any complaints about our policy or practices please let us know through this help page . If you are not</p>
<p>satisfied with our response, you can contact TRUSTe.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor.</strong> Facebook also adheres to the Safe Harbor framework developed by the U.S. Department of</p>
<p>Commerce and the European Union. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor, we agree to resolve all disputes</p>
<p>you have with us in connection with our policies and practices through TRUSTe. To view our certification, visit the</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Scope.</strong> This privacy policy covers all of Facebook. It does not, however, apply to entities that Facebook does not</p>
<p>own or control, such as Facebook-enhanced applications and websites. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree</p>
<p>to our privacy practices outlined here.</p>
<p><strong>No information from children under age 13.</strong> If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for</p>
<p>Facebook or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal</p>
<p>information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we</p>
<p>might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Parental participation.</strong> We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for</p>
<p>permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage</p>
<p>parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children</p>
<p>about safe internet use can be found on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal information.</strong> When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;"> </p>

<p></span>date. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to provide additional profile information, such as</p>
<p>where you went to school and where you work, and to add a picture of yourself, to help your friends connect with</p>
<p>you. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you.</p>
<p>Once you register you can visit your profile at any time to add or remove personal information about yourself. You</p>
<p>can add basic information about yourself, such as information about your hometown, family, relationships, and your</p>
<p>political and religious views. You can also add other information about yourself including your activities, interests,<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>contact information, as well as more information about your education and job history. </p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong> One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when</p>
<p>you update your status, upload or take a photo, upload or record a video, share a link, create an event or a group,</p>
<p>make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want</p>
<p>us to store metadata associated with content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the</p>
<p>metadata before uploading the content. </p>
<p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong> We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook.</p>
<p>However, we will only keep your payment source account number with your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can</p>
<p>find your friends on Facebook, and invite your contacts who do not have Facebook accounts to join. If you do not</p>
<p>want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we</p>
<p>will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts’ information.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you share your location with others or add a location to something you post, we</p>
<p>treat that like any other content you post (for example, it is subject to your privacy settings). If we offer a service</p>
<p>that supports this type of location sharing we will present you with an opt-in choice of whether you want to</p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding a friend, becoming</p>
<p>a fan of a Facebook Page, joining a group or an event, creating a photo album, sending a gift, poking another user,</p>
<p>indicating you “like” a post, attending an event, or authorizing an application. In some cases you are also taking an</p>
<p>action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the</p>
<p>actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact you shared it. </p>
<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or</p>
<p>other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as</p>
<p>well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your</p>
<p>computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Facebook easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to</p>
<p>protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to</p>
<p>make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are</p>
<p>logged into Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our</p>
<p>widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your</p>
<p>browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook. </p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect.</strong> We do not own or operate the applications that you use through</p>
<p>Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities) or the websites that you interact with through Facebook Connect.</p>
<p>We refer to them as “Facebook-enhanced” applications and websites because they use our Platform to provide you</p>
<p>with social features. Whenever you authorize a Facebook-enhanced application or website, we will receive</p>
<p>information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the</p>
<p>process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you authorize the application or</p>
<p>website. </p>
<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in</p>
<p>which they share information with us: </p>
<ul>
<li>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison</li>
</ul>
<p>purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as</p>
<p>“conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements</p>
<p>you see.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in</li>
</ul>
<p>order to measure the effectiveness of those ads. </p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days,</p>
<p>meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only</p>
<p>use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when</p>
<p>a friend tags you in a photo or video, provides friend details, or indicates a relationship with you. You can limit who</p>
<p>can see that you have been tagged in a photo or video – which we refer to as photos or videos “of me” – in your</p>
<p>privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>3. Information You Share With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that others use information that you share on Facebook in a manner consistent with your</p>
<p>privacy settings, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules. Read the following section to learn more</p>
<p>about how you can protect yourself when you share information with third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing information on Facebook.</strong> We designed our privacy settings to enable you to control how you share</p>
<p>your information on Facebook. You should review the default privacy settings to make sure they reflect your</p>
<p>preferences. Here are some specific things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can control the visibility of most of the information you share on Facebook through the privacy settings you</li>
</ul>
<p>select. </p>
<ul>
<li>Certain categories of information such as your name, profile photo, list of friends and pages you are a fan of,</li>
</ul>
<p>gender, <span style="background-color: green;">geographic region, </span>and networks you belong to are considered publicly available, and therefore do not have<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>privacy settings.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>(We will soon stop using regional networks, but your geographic region will still be considered publicly available).</span> You<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>can</span> <span style="background-color: red;">limit the ability of others to find this information on third party sear</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">h engines through your se</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">rch</span> <span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">pr</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">v</span><span style="background-color: green;">mit the </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">c</span><span style="background-color: green;">bilit</span>y<span style="background-color: green;"> of others to find this information on third party search engines through your</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">search privacy </span>settings. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friends’ home pages and other pages</li>
</ul>
<p>they visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain</li>
</ul>
<p>viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your</p>
<p>privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You understand that information might be re-shared or copied by other users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you post information on another user’s profile or comment on another user’s post, that information will be</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>subject to the other user’s privacy settings. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you use an external source to publish information to Facebook (such as a mobile application or a Connect site),</li>
</ul>
<p>you should check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.</p>
<p><strong>“Everyone” Privacy Setting.</strong> Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, may be accessed by</p>
<p>everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into Facebook), is subject to indexing by third party search</p>
<p>engines, may be associated with you outside of Facebook (such as when you visit other sites on the internet), and</p>
<p>may be imported and exported by us and others without privacy limitations. The default privacy setting for certain</p>
<p>types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.” You can review and change the default settings in</p>
<p>your privacy settings. If you delete “everyone” content that you posted on Facebook, we will remove it from your</p>
<p>Facebook profile, but have no control over its use outside of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Facebook-enhanced applications or</p>
<p>websites. That means that when you visit Facebook-enhanced applications and websites you are making your</p>
<p>Facebook information available to someone other than Facebook. To help those applications and sites operate, they</p>
<p>receive publicly available information automatically when you visit them, and additional information when you</p>
<p>formally authorize or connect your Facebook account with them. You can learn more details about which information</p>
<p>the operators of those applications and websites can access on our About Platform page. Prior to allowing them to</p>
<p>access any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their use of your information (which</p>
<p>you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to</p>
<p>ensure that they only obtain authorized information. We also give you tools to control how your information is</p>
<p>shared with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can choose to opt-out of Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect altogether through your privacy settings </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can block specific applications from accessing your information by visiting your application settings or the</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>application’s “About” page</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use your privacy settings to limit which of your information is available to “everyone” (by default, every</li>
</ul>
<p>application and website, including those you have not connected with, can access “everyone” and other publicly</p>
<p>available content) </p>
<ul>
<li>You can use your application settings to limit which of your information your friends can make available to</li>
</ul>
<p>applications and websites</p>
<ul>
<li>We may make information about the location of your computer or access device and your age available to</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook –enhanced applications and websites in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and</p>
<p>control the distribution of age-appropriate content. </p>
<p>You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with</p>
<p>the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If</p>
<p>you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us on this help page and</p>
<p>we will take action as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Exporting Information.</strong> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds,</p>
<p>mobile phone address books, or copy and paste functions, to capture and export information from Facebook,</p>
<p>including your information and information about you.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure</p>
<p>the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may opt-out of the placement of cookies</p>
<p>by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement</p>
<p>of cookies by advertising networks. </p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices</p>
<p>of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of</p>
<p>the details on how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to</p>
<p>measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the</p>
<p>information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. For</p>
<p>example, we ask for your date of birth to verify that you are over age 13 and so that we can better limit your</p>
<p>access to content and advertisements that are not age appropriate. We also use a variety of technological systems</p>
<p>to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on</p>
<p>occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of</p>
<p>all communications except essential updates on your account notifications page. We may include content you see on</p>
<p>Facebook in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We don’t share your information with advertisers without your</p>
<p>consent. (An example of consent would be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser to</p>
<p>receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements</p>
<p>and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may</p>
<p>have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or</p>
<p>preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use your interest</p>
<p>in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment company who you are. You</p>
<p>can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your</p>
<p>information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement</p>
<p>there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they</p>
<p>selected. </p>
<p><strong>To serve social ads.</strong> We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you</p>
<p>and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends. For example, if</p>
<p>you become a fan of a Page, we may display your name and profile photo next to an advertisement for that Page</p>
<p>that is displayed to your friends. We only share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the</p>
<p>friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to</p>
<p>supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update). In such cases</p>
<p>we generally allow you to direct how that information is shared in your privacy settings or give you the ability to</p>
<p>remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>To make Suggestions.</strong> We use your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers,</p>
<p>and other relevant information, to help you connect with your friends, including making suggestions to you and</p>
<p>other users that you connect with on Facebook. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other</p>
<p>people, you can adjust your search visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the</p>
<p>extent you choose to be visible in public search listings. You may also block specific individual users from being</p>
<p>suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our</p>
<p>browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our</p>
<p>collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive</p>
<p>photos when you use our photo uploader. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such</p>
<p>information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide</p>
<p>whether you want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In</p>
<p>such cases we restrict profile access to confirmed friends, and allow friends and family to write on the user’s Wall in</p>
<p>remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user’s next of kin or other proper</p>
<p>legal request to do so.</p>
<p><strong>5. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your networks — while providing you with</p>
<p>privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information</p>
<p>with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or</p>
<p>when legally required to do so. For example:</p>
<p><strong>When you make a payment.</strong> When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Facebook, we</p>
<p>will only share transaction information with those third parties necessary to complete the transaction and will require</p>
<p>those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information. </p>
<p><strong>When you invite a friend to join.</strong> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook, we will send your friend a</p>
<p>message on your behalf using your name. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If your</p>
<p>friend does not want us to keep their information, we will remove it at their request on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</strong> You may choose to share information with</p>
<p>marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Facebook through on-site offers. This is</p>
<p>entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available</p>
<p>in search results on Facebook to help your friends find you. However, you can control who has access to this</p>
<p>information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We also partner with email and</p>
<p>instant messaging providers to help their users identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can</p>
<p>promote Facebook to those users. </p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search engines’ access</p>
<p>to our site. We may allow them to access information set to the “everyone” setting and your public search listing</p>
<p>(but you can turn off your public search listing in your privacy settings). </p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service.</strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to</p>
<p>help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or</p>
<p>linked to any specific action or information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the</p>
<p>services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about</p>
<p>Facebook, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links</p>
<p>(including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a</p>
<p>limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of</p>
<p>that information to helping us provide the service.</p>
<p><strong>To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services.</p>
<p>We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other</p>
<p>information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in</p>
<p>the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service.</p>
<p>However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you use</p>
<p>that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court</p>
<p>orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is</p>
<p>required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have</p>
<p>a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from</p>
<p>that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information</p>
<p>when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily</p>
<p>harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. This may</p>
<p>include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Beacon.</strong> [We have announced a settlement of a lawsuit related to the Beacon product: the Beacon</p>
<p>product will be discontinued and this language removed from the privacy policy upon approval of a settlement by the</p>
<p>court.] Facebook Beacon is a means of sharing actions you have taken on third party sites, such as when you make</p>
<p>a purchase or post a review, with your friends on Facebook. In order to provide you as a Facebook user with clear</p>
<p>disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with your friends on</p>
<p>Facebook, we collect certain information from that site and present it to you after you have completed an action on</p>
<p>that site. You have the choice to have us discard that information, or to share it with your friends. To learn more</p>
<p>about the operation of the service, we encourage you to read the tutorial here. To opt out of the service</p>
<p>altogether, click here. Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some</p>
<p>information even if you are logged out from Facebook, or that pertains to non-Facebook users, from those sites in</p>
<p>conjunction with the technical operation of the system. In cases where we receive information from Beacon sites on</p>
<p>users that are not logged in, or on non-Facebook users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Facebook</p>
<p>accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a</p>
<p>case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Viewing and editing your profile.</strong> You may change or delete your profile information at any time by going to</p>
<p>your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately. While you cannot delete</p>
<p>your date of birth, you can use the setting on the info tab of your profile information page to hide all or part of it</p>
<p>from other users.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on</p>
<p>this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete</p>
<p>it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile</p>
<p>information (friends, photos, interests, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users</p>
<p>deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they</p>
<p>return to Facebook. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety.</p>
<p>When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete your account if you are certain you</p>
<p>never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account settings page or delete your account</p>
<p>on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of</p>
<p>that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise</p>
<p>distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no</p>
<p>longer be associated with that information on Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another user’s</p>
<p>profile, and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook</p>
<p>User.”) Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if</p>
<p>deletion has been requested.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be</p>
<p>available to others. </p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user</p>
<p>but you want us to delete your address, you can do so on this help page. However, that request will only apply to</p>
<p>addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later. </p>
<p><strong>7. How We Protect Information</strong> </p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about</p>
<p>staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server</p>
<p>behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt</p>
<p>that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to</p>
<p>enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use</p>
<p>of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content,</p>
<p>and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your</p>
<p>information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions</p>
<p>of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view</p>
<p>your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Facebook will not become publicly available. We</p>
<p>are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Facebook. You can</p>
<p>reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different</p>
<p>passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software. </p>
<p><strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on this help page. </p>
<p><strong>8. Other Terms</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong>. We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Facebook Statement of</p>
<p>Rights and Responsibilities. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we</p>
<p>have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here</p>
<p>and on the Facebook Site Governance Page. You can make sure that you receive notice directly by becoming a fan</p>
<p>of the Facebook Site Governance Page.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States.</strong> By using Facebook, you consent to having your</p>
<p>personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Defined Terms.</strong> "Us," "we," "our," "Platform" and "Facebook" mean the same as they do in the Statement of Rights</p>
<p>and Responsibilities. “Information” and “content” are used more generally and interchangeably here than in the</p>
<p>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities unless otherwise limited by the context. </p>
