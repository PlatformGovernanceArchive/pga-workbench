<p>About Thefacebook and the Information We Collect</p>
<p>Thefacebook is an online directory and social networking community that helps people find</p>
<p>friends and other people. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles and</p>
<p>privacy settings, and some personal information we ask for is displayed to people in the</p>
<p>groups specified in the users' privacy settings. </p>
<p>Information Collected by Thefacebook</p>
<p>Thefacebook collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address</p>
<p>to identify users and send notifications related to use of the site. Thefacebook also collects</p>
<p>user-submitted profile information such as gender, field, location, courses, etc.</p>
<p>Thefacebook also collects information that is not personally identifiable and not submitted</p>
<p>directly by users, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all</p>
<p>users to the site.</p>
<p>Thefacebook collects information from other sources, such as newspapers and instant</p>
<p>messaging services. This information is gathered regardless of use of the site. </p>
<p>Use of Information Obtained by Thefacebook</p>
<p>Profile information, as well as name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the groups</p>
<p>specified in a user's privacy settings to support the function of the site. Except when</p>
<p>inviting a friend to join the site, a user's name and email will never be given to anyone</p>
<p>outside the site. No information submitted to Thefacebook will be available to any user of</p>
<p>the site who does not belong to at least one of the groups specified in a user's privacy</p>
<p>settings.</p>
<p>We use server, IP and browser type for site administration. We also use information not</p>
<p>directly submitted to Thefacebook by users to supplement users' profiles unless they</p>
<p>specify that they do not want this done in their privacy settings. </p>
<p>Spam Policy</p>
<p>Email addresses will never be sold to anyone, and they will not be used for spam or any</p>
<p>other purpose outside of the site itself. </p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>This site may contain links to other websites. Thefacebook is not responsible for the privacy</p>
<p>practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our</p>
<p>site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally</p>
<p>identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by</p>
<p>this web site. </p>
<p>Use of Cookies</p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the</p>
<p>user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies</p>
<p>terminate once the users close the browser. We do not and will not use cookies to collect</p>
<p>private information from any user. </p>
<p>Third Party Advertising</p>
<p>Advertisements that appear on this web site are delivered to users by our advertising</p>
<p>partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows the advertising</p>
<p>network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In this</p>
<p>way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your</p>
<p>computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This</p>
<p>information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they</p>
<p>believe will be of most interest to you. Thefacebook does not have access to or control of</p>
<p>the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertising servers of ad networks.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Thefacebook and does not cover the</p>
<p>use of cookies by any of its advertisers. </p>
<p>Changing or Removing Information</p>
<p>Thefacebook users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by</p>
<p>logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately and old information will</p>
<p>never be displayed to any user of the site. </p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>Thefacebook accounts are password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to</p>
<p>protect our users' information. Passwords are stored in hashed form in our database, and</p>
<p>different sections of users' profiles are stored in different parts of our database to</p>
<p>separate access to all of the information and make it more difficult to piece everything</p>
<p>together. If you have any questions about the security of our web site, please contact us. </p>
<p>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, we will post</p>
<p>the changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect,</p>
<p>how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use</p>
<p>users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time</p>
<p>of collection, we will notify users via email. </p>

<p>this to be done.</p>
<p>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</p>
<p>We may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with</p>
<p>which we have a relationship. For example:</p>
<p>• We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we</p>
<p>offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to send</p>
<p>email solicitations. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our</p>
<p>service providers may have access to your personal information for use in connection</p>
<p>with these business activities.</p>
<p>• We may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests,</p>
<p>such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is</p>
<p>necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include</p>
<p>sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>• If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Thefacebook business were to</p>
<p>change, your user information would likely be transferred to the new owner.</p>

<p>to share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, please submit a</p>
<p>request by emailing us at info@thefacebook.com. We will make every effort to implement</p>
