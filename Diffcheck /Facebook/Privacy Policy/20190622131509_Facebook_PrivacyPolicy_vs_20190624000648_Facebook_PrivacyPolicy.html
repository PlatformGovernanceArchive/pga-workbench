<p>you make, the ads you see and how you use their services – whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in to</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a</p>
<p>purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party</p>
<p>data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>
<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties that they work with. We require each of</p>

<p><strong>Information across Facebook Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on different</p>
<p>Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products that you</p>
<p>use, wherever you use them. For example, we can su</span>g<span style="background-color: green;">gest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you</p>
<p>follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for</p>
<p>example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product</p>

<p>advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of</p>
<p>people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps and services. Learn how we share information</p>
<p>with these partners.</p>
<p><strong>Promote safety, integrity and security.</strong></p>
<p>We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other</p>
<p>bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when</p>
<p>someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Facebook Security Help Centre and Instagram Security Tips.</p>

<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing on Facebook Products</strong></p>
<p><strong>People and accounts that you share and communicate with</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you</p>
<p>post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customised list of</p>
<p>people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and</p>
<p>businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including</p>
<p>engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p><strong>Public information</strong> can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your</p>
<p>Instagram username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace.</p>
<p>You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off</p>
<p>our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results or through tools and</span> APIs<span style="background-color: green;">.</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and</span><span style="background-color: green;">Public</span> <span style="background-color: red;">SDK</span><span style="background-color: green;">information</p>
<p>can al</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">o be seen</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">or the</p>

<p>visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services</p>
<p>—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into</p>
<p>Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our</span> API<span style="background-color: red;"> to tell u</span>s<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>what</span> <span style="background-color: red;">g</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">nd</span><span style="background-color: red;">mes</span> <span style="background-color: red;">y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">ff</span><span style="background-color: red;">u p</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">ine</p>

<p>Learn</span> <span style="background-color: green;">more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content that others share or reshare about you.</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to</p>
<p>share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For</p>
<p>example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare</p>
<p>that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also,</p>
<p>when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see</p>
<p>the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>
<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people</p>
<p>can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or</p>
<p>messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>
<p>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently</p>
<p>active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>

<p>receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a</p>
<p>Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities</p>
<p>in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>

<p>Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves)</span>.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our</p>
<p>own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share</p>
<p>with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will</em></p>
<p><em>remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are</em></p>
<p><em>changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only</em></p>
<p><em>name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our </span>P<span style="background-color: red;">a</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">odu</span><span style="background-color: red;">tners re</span>c<span style="background-color: green;">ts or th</span>ei<span style="background-color: green;">r assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their</p>
<p>posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram</p>
<p>business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their</p>
<p>posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to</p>
<p>contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and</p>
<p>interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led</p>
<p>you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>

<p>audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,</p>
<p>you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,</p>
<p>the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use</p>

<p>see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. </p>
<p>Public information</p>
<p>Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,</p>
<p>including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram</p>

<p>visibility on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>
<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who</p>
<p>can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others</p>
<p>on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the</p>
<p>audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a</p>
<p>message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,</p>
<p>or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or</p>
<p>in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and</p>
<p>Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products that you use. We also</p>
<p>process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with</p>
<p>their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take</p>
<p>appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact</p>
<p>with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.</p>
<p><strong>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products or until your account is deleted – whichever</p>
<p>comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed,</p>
<p>and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete</p>
<p>that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your valid</p>
<p>photo ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content that you have</p>
<p>shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to</p>
<p>recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want</p>
<p>to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at</p>
<p>any time, please visit the Facebook settings and Instagram settings.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to</p>
<p>do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief</p>
<p>that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised</p>
<p>standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products,</p>
<p>breaches of our Terms or Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products),</p>
<p>you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if</p>
<p>relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent</p>
<p>fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and</p>
<p>preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of</p>
<p>possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term</p>
<p>breaches for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</strong></p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect</p>
<p>and share with around the world in accordance with this Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored</p>
<p>and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data</p>
<p>transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms, and to globally operate and provide</p>
<p>our Products to you. We utilise standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to</p>

<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>

<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>

<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use</p>
<p>may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with</p>
<p>them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers</p>
<p>may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).</p>
<p>Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own</p>
<p>terms and policies, not this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and</p>
<p>Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them,</p>
<p>including information your friends share with you, so they can provide</p>
<p>our core functionality to you. </p>
<p>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</p>
<p>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</p>
<p>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app</p>
<p>in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we</p>
<p>will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</p>
<p>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email</p>
<p>address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't</p>
<p>sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict</p>
<p>restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the</p>
<p>types of third parties we share information with: </p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>

<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>
<p>information about the number of people or accounts who viewed,</p>
<p>reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate</p>
<p>demographic and other information that helps them understand</p>
<p>interactions with their Page or account.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>
<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing</p>
<p>their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share</p>
<p>information that personally identifies you (information such as your</p>
<p>name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or</p>
<p>identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we</p>
<p>provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34</p>
<p>who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better</p>
<p>understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you</p>
<p>to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to</p>
<p>provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>

<p>the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping</p>
<p>and contact details.</p>

<p>innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological</p>
<p>advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>

<p>How do the Facebook Companies work</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on</p>
<p>its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p>How can I manage or delete information</p>
<p>about me?</p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you</p>
<p>submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete</p>
<p>that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have</p>
<p>shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos</p>
<p>and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information</p>
<p>that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you</p>
<p>don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you</p>
<p>can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the</p>
<p>Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.</p>

<p>How do we respond to legal requests or</p>
<p>prevent harm?</p>
<p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or</p>
<p>others:</p>
<p>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if</p>
<p>we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include</p>
<p>responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when</p>
<p>we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally</p>
<p>recognized standards.</p>
<p>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,</p>
<p>property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or</p>
<p>regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if</p>
<p>relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party</p>
<p>partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other</p>
<p>harmful activity on and off our Products.</p>
<p>Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to</p>
<p>purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period</p>
<p>when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or</p>
<p>investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent</p>
<p>harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least</p>
<p>a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>

<p>How do we operate and transfer data as</p>
<p>part of our global services?</p>
<p>We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and</p>
<p>externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world</p>
<p>in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or</p>
<p>transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of</p>
<p>where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are</p>
<p>necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms</p>
<p>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract</p>
<p>clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries,</p>
<p>as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and</p>
<p>other countries.</p>

<p>How will we notify you of changes to this</p>
<p>policy?</p>
