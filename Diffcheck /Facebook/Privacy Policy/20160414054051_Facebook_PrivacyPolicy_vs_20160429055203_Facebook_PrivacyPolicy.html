<p></span>friend's<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">control whether we </span>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and Tagging” settings.</p>
<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in your area or tell your<span style="background-color: red;"> friends that</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">friends that </span>you are nearby.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">products or </span>features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with you.</strong> We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and </span>terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Show and measure ads and services.</strong> We use the information we have to improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and<span style="background-color: red;"> off our</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">off our </span>Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services. Learn more about advertising on our Services and how you can control how information<span style="background-color: red;"> about you is used</span></p>

<p></span>customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
