<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about creating engaging and customized experiences for people. We use all of the information we have to help us provide and support our Services. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Provide, improve and develop Services.</strong> We are able to deliver our Services, personalize content, and make suggestions for you by using this information to understand how you</p>
<p>use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to and interested in on and off our Services.</p>
<p>We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your friend's</p>
<p>pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether we</p>
<p>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and Tagging” settings.</p>
<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in your area or tell your friends that</p>
<p>you are nearby.</p>
<p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or</p>
<p>features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>
<p><strong></span>Co<span style="background-color: green;">mmunicate with y</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u.</strong> We use your information to send you mar</span>k<span style="background-color: red;">i</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">ting</span> <span style="background-color: green;">communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies and</p>
<p>terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>

<p>Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services. Learn more about advertising on our Services and how you can control how information about you is used</p>
<p>to personalize the ads you see.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: green;">investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers, automated systems, and advanced</p>

<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Sharing On Our Services</p>
<p>People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by sharing your information in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>People you share and communicate with.</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience</p>
<p>for the post, such as a customized group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group. Likewise, when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you send</p>
<p>photos to or message.</p>
<p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience, as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a Facebook Page or another public</p>
<p>forum. Public information is available to anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through online search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on </span>T<span style="background-color: green;">V.</span><span style="background-color: red;">erms</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download or re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you comment on another person’s</p>
<p>post or like their content on Facebook, that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If their audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>
<p><strong>People that see content others share about you.</strong> Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people may share</p>
<p>a photo of you, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s post, social reporting is a</p>
<p>way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust. Learn </span>More<span style="background-color: green;">.</span><span style="background-color: red;"> Resources</span></p>

<p>identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising,</p>
<p>measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without</p>
<p>providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how</p>
<p>its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year</p>
<p>old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by</p>
<p>our advertiser guidelines.</p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences if you want to control and manage</p>

<p><strong>Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or</p>

<p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other</p>
<p>information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the</p>
<p>information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not</p>
<p>share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable</p>

<p>be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising,</p>
<p>measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We</p>
<p>may provide these partners with information about the reach and</p>
<p>effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that</p>
<p>it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser</p>
<p>how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed</p>
<p>an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying</p>
<p>demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who</p>
<p>likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand</p>
<p>their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to</p>
<p>abide by our advertiser guidelines. </p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re</p>
<p>seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences if</p>
<p>you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook</span>.</p>
