<p><strong>2. Information We Receive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information About Yourself.</strong> When you sign up for Facebook you provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the registration process<span style="background-color: red;"> we give you the opportunity to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">we give you the opportunity to </span>connect with your friends, schools, and employers. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask<span style="background-color: red;"> for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p>Login</p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p>for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific </span>services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself by<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>connecting with, for example, your current city, hometown, family, relationships, networks, activities,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>interests, and places. You can also provide personal<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information about yourself, such as your political and religious views.</p>
<p><strong>Content.</strong> One of the primary reasons people use Facebook is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your status, upload or take a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>photo, upload or record a video,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>share a link, create an event or a group, make a comment, write something on someone’s Wall, write a note, or send<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>before uploading the content.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong> We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Facebook. If you do not want us to store your payment<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>source account number, you can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>remove it using your payments page. </p>
<p><strong>Friend Information.</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can find your friends on Facebook, and invite<span style="background-color: red;"> your contacts who do not have</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">your contacts who do not have </span>Facebook accounts to join. If you do not want us to store this information, visit this help page. If you give us your password to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>have uploaded your contacts’ information.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect when you interact with Facebook:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site activity information.</strong> We keep track of some of the actions you take on Facebook, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>friend), creating a photo album,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sending a gift, poking another user, indicating you “like” a post, attending an event, or connecting with an application. In some<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.</p>
<p><strong>Access Device and Browser Information.</strong> When you access Facebook from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>that device about your browser type,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>make Facebook easier to use, to make<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>our advertising better, and to protect both you and Facebook. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>back to Facebook. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Facebook, and to know when you are interacting with Facebook Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>buttons, and our advertisements.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through Facebook Platform (such as games and utilities). Whenever<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you connect with a Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>limited amount of information even before you connect with the application or website.<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p>Keep me logged in</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</span></p>
<p><strong>Information from other websites.</strong> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the ads acted on their site). This data<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
<p>We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>ads.</p>
<p>If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>with any particular user. If we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>below.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other users.</strong> We may collect information about you from other Facebook users, such as when a friend tags you in a photo, video, or place,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>provides friend details, or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>indicates a relationship with you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sharing information on Facebook.</strong> </p>
<p>This section explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared on Facebook. You should always consider your privacy settings<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>before sharing information on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Name and Profile Picture.</strong> Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>not have privacy settings. If you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one). You can also control who can find<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you when searching on Facebook or on public search engines using the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Applications and Websites privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> Your contact information settings control (available when customizing your privacy settings) who can contact you on Facebook, and<span style="background-color: red;"> who can see your contact information</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">who can see your contact information </span>such as your email and phone number(s). Remember that none of this information is required except for your email<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>address, and you do not have to share your email address with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Your personal information settings control who can see your personal information, such as your religious and political views, if you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>choose to add them. We recommend<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that you share this information using the friends of friends setting.</p>
<p><strong>Posts by Me.</strong> You can select a privacy setting for every post you make using the publisher on our site. Whether you are uploading a photo or posting a status<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>update, you can control exactly<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>who can see it at the time you create it. Whenever you share something look for the lock icon. Clicking on the lock will bring<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>up a menu that lets you choose who will be able to see your post. If<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you decide not to select your setting at the time you post the content, your content will be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>shared consistent with your Posts by Me default privacy </p>
<p>(available when customizing your privacy settings).</p>
<p><strong>Gender and Birth Date.</strong> In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the registration process. We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>ask for your date of birth to verify<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>that you are 13 or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content and advertisements that are not age<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>delete them. You can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>fields from other users.</p>
<p><strong>Other.</strong> Here are some other things to remember:</p>
<p>Some of the content you share and the actions you take will show up on your friends’ home pages and other pages they visit.</p>
<p>If another user tags you in a photo or video or at a place, you can remove the tag. You can also limit who can see that you have been tagged on your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>profile from your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>has been shared with others, it was<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.</p>
<p>You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users.</p>
<p>Certain types of communications that you send to other users cannot be removed, such as messages.</p>
<p>When you post information on another user’s profile or comment on another user’s post, that information will be subject to the other user’s privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>settings.</p>
<p>If you use an external source to publish information to Facebook (such as a mobile application or a Connect site), you should check the privacy setting<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>for that post, as it is set by that external<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>source.</p>
<p><strong>“Everyone” Information.</strong> Information set to “everyone” is publicly available information, just like your name, profile picture, and connections. Such<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information may, for example, be accessed<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>by everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into Facebook), be indexed by third party search engines,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>without privacy limitations. Such information may also be associated with you,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>including your name and profile picture, even outside of Facebook, such as on public search engines and when you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>visit other sites on the internet. The default<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “everyone.” You can review and change the default settings in your<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>privacy</span> <span style="background-color: green;">privacy</p>
<p></span>settings. If you delete “everyone” content that you posted on Facebook, we will remove it from your Facebook profile, but have no control over its use outside<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>of Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Minors.</strong> We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the<span style="background-color: red;"> ability of adults to share and</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">ability of adults to share and </span>connect with minors, recognizing this may provide minors a more limited experience on Facebook</p>
<p><strong>4. Information You Share With Third Parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Platform.</strong> As mentioned above, we do not own or operate the applications or websites that use Facebook Platform. That means that when you<span style="background-color: red;"> use those applications and websites</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">use those applications and websites </span>you are making your Facebook information available to someone other than Facebook. Prior to allowing them to access<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>any information about you, we require them to agree to terms that limit their<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>use of your information (which you can read about in Section 9 of our Statement of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Rights and Responsibilities) and we use technical measures to ensure that they only obtain authorized<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information. To learn more about Platform, visit our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>About Platform page.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting with an Application or Website.</strong> When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you. The<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>term General Information includes<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>your and your friends’ names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections, and any content shared using the Everyone<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>privacy setting. We may also make information about the location of<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>your</span> <span style="background-color: red;">computer or access device and </span>your <span style="background-color: red;">age available to appli</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">ati</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">mpu</span><span style="background-color: red;">ns and websi</span>te<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">r</span> <span style="background-color: red;">in</span><span style="background-color: green;">or</span> <span style="background-color: green;">access device and your age available to applications and websites in</p>
<p></span>order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>content. If the application or website wants to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission.</p>
<p>We give you tools to control how your information is shared with applications and websites that use Platform. For example, you can block all platform<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>applications and websites completely or block<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>specific applications from accessing your information by visiting your Applications and Websites privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>setting or the specific application’s “About” page. You can also use your privacy settings to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>limit which of your information is available to “everyone”.</p>
<p>You should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you share with them. We do not<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or website that violates our rules, you should report the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>violation to us on this help page and we will take action as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>When your friends use Platform.</strong> If your friend connects with an application or website, it will be able to access your name, profile picture, gender, user ID,<span style="background-color: red;"> and information you have shared</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and information you have shared </span>with “everyone.” It will also be able to access your connections, except it will not be able to access your friend list. If you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>have already connected with (or have a separate account with) that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>website or application, it may also be able to connect you with your friend on that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>application or website. If the application or website wants to access any of your other content or information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>(including your friend list), it will have to obtain<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>specific permission from your friend. If your friend grants specific permission to the application or website, it will generally only be able to access<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>content</span> <span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">co</span>n<span style="background-color: red;">d</span><span style="background-color: green;">tent</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and</p>
<p></span>information about you that your friend can access. In addition, it will only be allowed to use that content and information in connection with that friend. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>example, if a friend gives<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>an application access to a photo you only shared with your friends, that application could allow your friend to view or print the photo,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>but it cannot show that photo to anyone else.</p>
<p>We provide you with a number of tools to control how your information is shared when your friend connects with an application or website. For example, you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>can use your Application and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Websites privacy setting to limit some of the information your friends can make available to applications and websites. You can<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>block all platform applications and websites completely or block<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>particular applications or websites from accessing your information. You can use your privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>settings to limit which friends can access your information, or limit which of your information is<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>available to “everyone.” You can also disconnect from a friend if<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you are uncomfortable with how they are using your information.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Approved Third-Party Websites and Applications.</strong> In order to provide you with useful social experiences off of Facebook, we occasionally need to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>provide General Information about<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them (if you are still logged<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>in to Facebook). Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website). In<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>these cases we require these websites and applications<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy. For example, these<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>agreements</span> <span style="background-color: green;">ag</span><span style="background-color: red;">include p</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">eeme</span><span style="background-color: red;">ovisio</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">t</span>s <span style="background-color: green;">include provisions</p>
<p></span>relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered. You can disable instant</p>
<p>personalization on all pre-approved websites and applications using your Applications and Websites privacy setting. You can also block a particular pre-<span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>approved website or application by clicking<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>"No Thanks" in the blue bar when you visit that application or website. In addition, if you log out of Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>before visiting a pre-approved application or website, it will not be able to access<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>your information.</p>
<p><strong>Exporting Information.</strong> You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>copy and paste functions, to capture,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>export (and in some cases, import) information from Facebook, including your information and information about you. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>For example, if you share your phone number with your friends, they may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>use third party applications to sync that information with the address book on their<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Facebook use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>personalize advertising content. You may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>opt-out of the placement of cookies by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks.</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> When you click on links on Facebook you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>read their privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>5. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:</p>
<p><strong>To manage the service.</strong> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features,<span style="background-color: red;"> and to provide you with customer</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and to provide you with customer </span>support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Responsibilities. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>some users.</p>
<p><strong>To contact you.</strong> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>on your account notifications page.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We may include content you see on Facebook in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p><strong>To serve personalized advertising to you.</strong> We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>asked us to provide your shipping<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>company who you are. You<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>can see the criteria advertisers may select by visiting our advertising page. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent,<span style="background-color: red;"> when</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">when </span>you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the criteria they selected.</p>
<p><strong>To serve social ads.</strong> We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements<span style="background-color: red;"> more interesting and more tailored to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">more interesting and more tailored to </span>you and your friends. For example, if you connect with your favorite band’s page, we may display your name and profile<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>photo next to an advertisement for that page that is displayed to your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>friends. We only share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>the friend who can see the ad. You can opt out of having your information used in social ads on this help<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>page.</p>
<p><strong>To supplement your profile.</strong> We may use information about you that we collect from other Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are<span style="background-color: red;"> tagged in a photo or mentioned in</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">tagged in a photo or mentioned in </span>a status update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.</p>
<p><strong>To make suggestions.</strong> We use your profile information, the addresses you import through our contact importers, and other relevant information, to help you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>connect with your friends,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>including making suggestions to you and other users that you connect with on Facebook. For example, if another user imports the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>same email address as you do, we may suggest that you connect<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>with each other. If you want to limit your visibility in suggestions we make to other people,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you can adjust your search visibility privacy setting, as you will only be visible in our suggestions to the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>extent you choose to be visible in public search listings.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>You may also block specific individual users from being suggested to you and you from being suggested to them.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>through contact importers and search. <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>You can prevent other users from using your email address to find you using the search section of your privacy settings.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable Software.</strong> Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>data to us. We may not make a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a<span style="background-color: red;"> disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you </span>want to use that feature.</p>
<p><strong>Memorializing Accounts.</strong> If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. In such cases we restrict profile access to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>confirmed friends, and allow friends and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>family to write on the user’s Wall in remembrance. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>user’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p>
<p><strong>6. How We Share Information</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your communities — while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to<span style="background-color: red;"> restrict other users from accessing</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">restrict other users from accessing </span>some of your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>so. For example:</p>
<p><strong>When you make a payment.</strong> When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Facebook, we will share transaction information with only<span style="background-color: red;"> those third parties necessary to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">those third parties necessary to </span>complete the transaction. We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.</p>
<p><strong>When you invite a friend to join.</strong> When you ask us to invite a friend to join Facebook, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. <span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>The invitation may also contain<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information about other users your friend might know. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. You can<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>see who has accepted your invitations, send reminders, and delete<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>your friends’ email addresses on your invite history page. If your friend does not want us to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>keep their information, we will also remove it at their request by using this help page.</p>
<p><strong>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</strong> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that<span style="background-color: red;"> are not associated with</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">are not associated with </span>Facebook through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>your consent.</p>
<p><strong>To help your friends find you.</strong> By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on Facebook to help your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>friends find you. However, you can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>control who can see some of this information, as well as who can find you in searches, through your privacy settings. We<span style="background-color: red;"> also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">also partner with email and instant messaging providers to help their users </span>identify which of their contacts are Facebook users, so that we can promote<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Facebook to those users.</p>
<p><strong>To give search engines access to publicly available information.</strong> We generally limit search engines’ access to our site. We may allow them to access<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information set to the “everyone”<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>setting (along with your name and profile picture) and your profile information that is visible to everyone. You can change the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>visibility of some of your profile information using the customize<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>section of your privacy settings. You can also prevent search engines from indexing your profile<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>using the Applications and Websites privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong>To help improve or promote our service.</strong> Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we<span style="background-color: red;"> only do so in such a way that no</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">only do so in such a way that no </span>individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with services.</strong> We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>parties to help host our website,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>send out email updates about Facebook, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when<span style="background-color: red;"> this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to </span>helping us provide the service.</p>
<p><strong>To advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers outside of Facebook to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>based on the presence of a cookie, but in<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>To offer joint services.</strong> We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Facebook Marketplace. If you use these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>services, we may share your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you before you use that service.</p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>and civil matters) if we have a good<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>when</span> w<span style="background-color: red;">e </span>h<span style="background-color: red;">av</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> a good faith belief it is </span>n<span style="background-color: red;">ecessary</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we have a good faith belief it is necessary</p>
<p></span>to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Statement of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Rights and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Responsibilities. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</strong> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to<span style="background-color: red;"> the new owner so that the</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">the new owner so that the </span>service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>7. How You Can Change or Remove Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing your profile.</strong> You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>will be updated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Delete uploaded contacts.</strong> If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page. You can delete the email<span style="background-color: red;"> addresses of friends you have invited</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">addresses of friends you have invited </span>to join Facebook on your invite history page.</p>
<p><strong>Deactivating or deleting your account.</strong> If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>will be able to see it, but it will<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>not be deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Facebook. You will<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your account<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>settings</span> <span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">pag</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ttings</span> <span style="background-color: red;">or</span><span style="background-color: green;">page</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or</p>
<p></span>delete your account on this help page.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on removal.</strong> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>elsewhere to the extent it has been<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>However, your name will no longer be associated with that information<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>on Facebook. (For example, if you post something to another user’s profile and then<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous Facebook User.”) <span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>Additionally, we may retain certain information to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>your</span> <span style="background-color: green;">your</p>
<p></span>information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access<span style="background-color: red;"> the information through our</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">the information through our </span>Platform after you disconnect from them.</p>
<p><strong>Backup copies.</strong> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-user contact information.</strong> If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Facebook user but you want us to delete your address, you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>can do so on this help page.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>to us later.</p>
<p><strong>8. How We Protect Information</strong> </p>
<p>We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>Security Page.</p>
<p><strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>information (such as credit card<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
