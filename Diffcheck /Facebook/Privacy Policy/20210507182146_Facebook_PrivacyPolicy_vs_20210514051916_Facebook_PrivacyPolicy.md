**Device Information**

**Device Information**

As described below, we collect information from and about the

computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices

you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this

information across different devices you use. For example, we use

information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to

better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when

you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or

to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed

you on your phone on a different device. 

Information we obtain from these devices includes: 

Device attributes:

Device attributes: information such as the operating system,

hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available

storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.

Device operations:

Device operations: information about operations and behaviors

performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded

or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish

humans from bots).

Identifiers:

Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such

as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or

other identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated

with the same device or account).

Device signals:

Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-

Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.

Data from device settings:

Data from device settings: information you allow us to receive

through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS

location, camera or photos.

Network and connections:

Network and connections: information such as the name of your

mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP

address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about

other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things

like help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.

**Information from partners.**

**Information from partners.**

Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information

through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins

(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the

Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about your activities

off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you

visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services

—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into

Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us

what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you

made in its store. We also receive information about your online and

offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have

the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through

third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have

lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data

to us. Learn more about the types of partners we receive data from.

Business Tools, review the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram

How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**Sharing on Facebook Products**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

**People and accounts you share and communicate with**

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the

audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,

you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends,

the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use

Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses,

those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network

can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including

engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts

see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories. 

Public information

Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,

including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram

username; any information you share with a public audience; information

in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook

Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as

Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram,

and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or

off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in

search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be

seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services

such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps,

websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 

Learn more about what information is public and how to control your

visibility on Facebook and Instagram.

**Content others share or reshare about you**

**Content others share or reshare about you**

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who

can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others

on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the

audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a

message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot,

or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or

in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you

comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your

comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's

content, and that person can change the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you

with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of

<span style="background-color: red;">with the audience the</span>y<span style="background-color: red;"> ch</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">u in a St</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">ry, m</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ntion or tag you at a location in a post, or share

Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our**

**Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our**

**Products.**

**Products.**

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that

use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information

about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with

your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a

website, the game developer or website can receive information about

your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share

from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such

third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and

any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use

may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with

them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other

information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about

any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers

may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).

Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own

terms and policies, not this one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and

Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)

will have access to all information you choose to share with them,

including information your friends share with you, so they can provide

our core functionality to you. 

Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even

further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'

access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app

in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we

will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to

include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email

address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.

**New owner.**

**New owner.**

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets

changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

**Sharing with Third-Party Partners**

We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who

use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to

operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't

sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict

restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the

types of third parties we share information with:

**Advertisers.**

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing

their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share

information that personally identifies you (information such as your

name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or

identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we

provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for

example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34

who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better

understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you

to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from

the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping

and contact details.

**Vendors and service providers.**

How do the Facebook Companies work

together?

Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other

Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,

relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.

We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these

purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.

For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on

<span style="background-color: green;">For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on

Data retention, account deactivation and

deletion</span>

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook

Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case

determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and

processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you

search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your

search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you

submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete

that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of

content you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. 

When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos

and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information

that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you

don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you

can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the

Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include

responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when

other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights,

regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if

relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party

partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other

harmful activity on and off our Products.

<span style="background-color: green;">harmful activity on and off our Products.

purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period

when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or

investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent

harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least

a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
