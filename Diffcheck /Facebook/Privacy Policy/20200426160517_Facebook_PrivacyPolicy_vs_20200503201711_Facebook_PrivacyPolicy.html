<p>How do we use this information?</p>
<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and</p>
<p>to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the</p>
<p>Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:</span></p>
<p><strong>Pro<span style="background-color: red;">vide, personalize and improve our Pro</span>ducts.</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that</p>
<p>use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information</p>
<p>about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with</p>
<p>your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website can receive information about</p>
<p>your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share</p>
<p>from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such</p>
<p>third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and</p>
<p>any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may</p>
<p>receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other</p>
<p>information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about</p>
<p>any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of</p>
<p>course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected</p>
<p>by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not</p>
<p>this one. </p>
<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook</p>
<p>and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)</p>
<p>will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including</p>
<p>information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core</p>
<p>functionality to you. </p>
<p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even</em></p>
<p><em>further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'</em></p>
<p><em>access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their</em></p>
<p><em>app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version,</em></p>
<p><em>we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to</em></p>
<p><em>include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and</em></p>
<p><em>email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>
<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets</p>
<p>changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</strong></p>
<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who</p>
<p>use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to</p>
<p>operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell</p>
<p>any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on</p>
<p>how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third</p>
