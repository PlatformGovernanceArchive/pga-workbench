<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and</p>
<p>businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings,</p>
<p>Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For</p>
<p>example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive</p>

<p>ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that</p>
<p>personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address</p>

<p>also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an</p>
<p>action with an advertiser.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>
<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to</p>
<p>provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do the Facebook Companies</strong></p>
<p><strong>work together?</strong></p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,</p>
<p>relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these</p>
<p>purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
<p>For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its</p>
<p>service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram</p>
<p>or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook</p>
<p>Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products.</p>

<p><strong>How can I manage or delete</strong></p>
<p><strong>information about me?</strong></p>
<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in</p>
<p>your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. </p>
<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook</p>
<p>Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case</p>
<p>determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and</p>
<p>processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you</p>
<p>search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your</p>
<p>search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit</p>
<p>a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy</p>
<p>30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and</p>
<p>cookie data obtained through social plugins. </p>
<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and</p>
<p>status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that</p>
<p>others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't</p>
<p>want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can</p>

<p><strong>II. How do we use this information?</strong></p>

<p>use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to and interested in on and off our Services.</p>
<p>We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your friend's</p>
<p>pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether we</p>
<p>suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Timeline and Tagging” settings.</p>
<p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in your area or tell your friends that</p>
<p>you are nearby.</p>
<p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or</p>
<p>features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>

<p><strong>III. How is this information shared?</strong></p>
<p>Sharing On Our Services</p>
<p>People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by sharing your information in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>People you share and communicate with.</strong></p>
<p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience</p>
<p>for the post, such as a customized group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group. Likewise, when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you send</p>
<p>photos to or message.</p>
<p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience, as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a Facebook Page or another public</p>
<p>forum. Public information is available to anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through online search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on TV.</p>
<p>In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download or re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you comment on another person’s</p>
<p>post or like their content on Facebook, that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If their audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>

<p><strong>People that see content others share about you.</strong> Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people may share</p>
<p>a photo of you, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s post, social reporting is a</p>
<p>way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust. Learn More.</span></p>

<p>they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use the Facebook Comment or Share button on a</p>
<p>website, the game developer or website may get information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from their website on Facebook. In</p>
<p>addition, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes your username or user ID, your age range and</p>
<p>country/language, your list of friends, as well as any information that you share with them. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their</p>
<p>own terms and policies.</p>
<p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with these apps and websites.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: red;">Sharing within Facebook companies.</strong> We share information we have about you within the family of companies that are part of Facebook. Learn more about our companies.</p>
<p><strong>New owner.</strong> If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
<p>Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers</p>
<p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our companies</p>
<p>and provide free services to people around the world.</p>
<p>Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you:</p>
<p><strong>Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally Identifiable Information Only).</strong> We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other</p>
<p>information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share information that personally</p>
<p>identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising,</p>
<p>measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without</p>
<p>providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how</p>
<p>its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year</p>
<p>old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by</p>
<p>our advertiser guidelines.</p>
<p>Please review your advertising preferences to understand why you’re seeing a particular ad on Facebook. You can adjust your ad preferences if you want to control and manage</p>
<p>your ad experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners.</strong> We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who globally support our business, such as providing</p>
<p>technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or</p>
<p>conducting academic research and surveys. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Data Policy and the agreements</p>
<p>we enter into with them.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>
<p>You can manage the content and information you share when you use Facebook through the Activity Log tool. You can also download information associated with your Facebook</p>
<p>account through our Download Your Information tool.</p>
<p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Information associated with your account will be</p>
<p>kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services.</p>
<p>You can delete your account any time. When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates. If you do not want to delete your</p>
<p>account, but want to temporarily stop using Facebook, you may deactivate your account instead. To learn more about deactivating or deleting your account, click here. Keep in mind</p>
<p>that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account.</p>
<p><strong>V. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law</p>
<p>requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required</p>
<p>by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when</p>
<p>we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to</p>
<p>prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of</p>
<p>our Services. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook, may be accessed, processed and retained for an</p>
<p>extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or</p>
<p>otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our</p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p><strong>VI. How our global services operate</strong></p>
<p>Facebook may share information internally within our family of companies or with third parties for purposes described in this policy. Information collected within the European</p>
<p>Economic Area (“EEA”) may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this policy. We utilize standard contract clauses approved</p>
<p>by the European Commission, adopt other means under European Union law, and obtain your consent to legitimize data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other</p>
<p>countries.</p>
<p>You can contact us using the information provided below with questions or concerns. We also may resolve disputes you have with us in connection with our privacy policies and</p>
<p>practices through TRUSTe. You can contact TRUSTe through their website.</p>
<p><strong>VII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</strong></p>
