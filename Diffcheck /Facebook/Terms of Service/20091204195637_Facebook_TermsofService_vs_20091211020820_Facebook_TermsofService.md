**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our

relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this

Statement.

<span style="background-color: green;">1. </span>**<span style="background-color: red;">1. </span>Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about<span style="background-color: red;"> how</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">how </span>you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>information. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.

<span style="background-color: green;">2. </span>**<span style="background-color: red;">2. </span>Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared<span style="background-color: red;"> through</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">through </span>your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"),<span style="background-color: red;"> you</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">you </span>specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings:<span style="background-color: red;"> you grant us</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">you grant us </span>a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>any IP content that<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>when you delete your IP<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>content or your account unless your content has been shared with others,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a<span style="background-color: red;"> computer.</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">computer. </span>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>reasonable period of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the

application. We require applications to respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that

application will control how the application can use the content and information you share. (To learn<span style="background-color: red;"> more</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">more </span>about Platform, read our About Platform page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone,<span style="background-color: red;"> including</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">including </span>people off of Facebook, will have access to that information and we may not have control<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>over what they<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>do with it.

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand<span style="background-color: red;"> that we</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">that we </span>may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
