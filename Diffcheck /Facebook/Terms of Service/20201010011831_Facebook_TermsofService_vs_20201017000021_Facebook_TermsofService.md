**Terms of Service**

Welcome to Facebook! 

Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to

connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses.

These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger and the other

products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we

offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly

state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are

provided to you by Facebook, Inc. 

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and

services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and

organisations pay us to show you ads for their products and services.

By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we

think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal

data to help determine which ads to show you. 

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share

information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email

address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give

us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as

the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show

those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers

with reports about the performance of their ads that help them

understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section

2 below to learn more. 

Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data

to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other

services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time

to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,

stories, events, ads and other content that you see in News Feed or our

video platform to the Pages that you follow and other features that you

might use, such as Trending, Marketplace and search. We use the data

that we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices

and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our

Products – to personalise your experience.

**Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:**

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organisations and others that matter to you across the Facebook Products

that you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you

and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow

or send a message to, shows to watch and people who you may want to

become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we

believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to

people, groups and organisations that they care about.

**Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what**

**matters to you:**

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to

communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you –

for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the

Facebook Products that you use, sending messages to a friend or several

people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We

have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use

technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share

more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.

**Help you discover content, products and services that may interest**

**you:**

We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you

discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many

businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Facebook

Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

**Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community:**

People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ

dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical

systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others

and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our

community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take

appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing content,

removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or

contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook

Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using

one of our Products.

**Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and**

**functional services for everyone:**

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence,

machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use

our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location.

For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual

impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on

Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and

communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in

areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve

our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may

harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

**Research ways to make our services better:**

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This

includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding

how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and

testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we

use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and

improving our services.

2. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using

the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that

businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company

Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and

interests, </span>to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means

that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We

don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things <span style="background-color: red;">l</span><span style="background-color: green;">such as the</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">r business

goal, and the </span>k<span style="background-color: red;">e the</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">r busi</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d</span><span style="background-color: red;">ess</span> <span style="background-color: red;">g</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">f </span>a<span style="background-color: green;">udience that they want to see their ads (for examp</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">e</span>,<span style="background-color: red;">

and</span> <span style="background-color: red;">the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for exam</span>p<span style="background-color: red;">l</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">, pe</span>ople between<span style="background-color: red;"> the age</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">the ages </span>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them

understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For

example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for

example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in

Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>don<span style="background-color: red;">’</span><span style="background-color: green;">'</span>t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or<span style="background-color: red;">

email</span> <span style="background-color: green;">email

</span>address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>you give<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.

you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have

controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we<span style="background-color: red;">

use</span> <span style="background-color: green;">use

</span>to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>3. Your commitments to Facebook<span style="background-color: green;">**</span><span style="background-color: red;"> and</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">**a</span><span style="background-color: red;">our commu</span>n<span style="background-color: green;">d our commun</span>ity<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we

need you to make the following commitments:

**1. Who can use Facebook**

<span style="background-color: green;">When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is

safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

use the same name that you use in everyday life;

provide accurate information about yourself;

create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for

personal purposes; and

not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to

others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our

permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot

use Facebook if:

You are under 13 years old.

You are a convicted sex offender.

We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms

or Policies.

You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or

software under applicable laws.

**2. What you can share and do on Facebook**

We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share

content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and

well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree

not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support

others in doing so):

1. You may not use our Products to do or share anything:

That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards, and

other Terms and Policies that apply to your use of Facebook.

That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.

That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including

their intellectual property rights.

2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that

could disable, overburden or impair the proper working or

appearance of our Products.

3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using

automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to

access data that you do not have permission to access.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these

provisions.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community

Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request

another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if

doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of

users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our

services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical

limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or

conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property

rights) or our terms and policies.

We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or

information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid

or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content

that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be

protected by intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘licence') to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products,

you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-

free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy,

publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of

your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you

give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support

our service or other Facebook Products you use.This licence will end

when your content is deleted from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your

account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your

account.

When you delete content, it's no longer visible to other users;

however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within

a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with this

licence and they have not deleted it (in which case, this

licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or

Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of

our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact

duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content

has been fully deleted.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about

your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in

connection with ads, offers and other sponsored content that we

display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For

example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an

advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has

paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen

only by people who have your permission to see the actions that

you've taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad

settings and preferences.

3. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you

download or use our software, you give us permission to download

and install updates to the software where available.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and

make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or

sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share

on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can

only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under

an open source licence) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile

or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to

review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in

3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using

automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to

access data you do not have permission to access.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these

provisions.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community

Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request

another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or

if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community

of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of

our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or

conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual

property rights) or our terms and policies.

We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or

information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to

avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.

**3. The permissions you give us**

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that

you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by

intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our

Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,

royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,

run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create

derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and

application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a

photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and

share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as

service providers that support our service or other Facebook

Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted

from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your

account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your

account.

When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,

however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted

within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with

this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this

license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);

or

where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

our terms and policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the

exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the

content has been fully deleted.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information

about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection

with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display

across our Products, without any compensation to you. For

example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an

advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has

paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen

only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've

taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and

preferences.

3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you

download or use our software, you give us permission to download

and install updates to the software where available.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have

and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos,

or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on

Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can

only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission

under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of,

decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

4. Additional provisions

**1. Updating our Terms**

**1. Updating our Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to

make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we

may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect

our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will

notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an

opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated

Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our

Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not

Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.

**2. Account suspension or termination**

**2. Account suspension or termination**

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to

express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached

our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards,

we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may

also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other

people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for

legal reasons.

Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options

you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to

legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere

with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or

Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or

where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been

disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your

<span style="background-color: green;">1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and

Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and

Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede

any prior agreements.

2. Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by

supplemental Terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental

terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement

with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for

commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling

products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your

business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our

Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music,

you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent that any

supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental

Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.

remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to

enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any

amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and

signed by us.

our products and services. But you should know that we may use

them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we

are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
