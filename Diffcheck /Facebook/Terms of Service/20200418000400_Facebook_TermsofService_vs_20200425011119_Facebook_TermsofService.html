<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>Welcome to Facebook! </p>
<p>Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to</p>
<p>connect with each other, build communities, and grow businesses.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other</p>
<p>products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer</p>
<p>(the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state</p>
<p>that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are</p>
<p>provided to you by Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p>We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and</p>
<p>services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organizations</p>
<p>pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our</p>
<p>Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be</p>
<p>relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help</p>
<p>determine which ads to show you. </p>
<p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share</p>
<p>information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email</p>
<p>address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give</p>
<p>us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to</p>
<p>people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports</p>
<p>about the performance of their ads that help them understand how</p>
<p>people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn</p>
<p>more. </p>
<p>Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to</p>
<p>determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services</p>
<p>described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review</p>
<p>the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.</p>

<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such</p>
<p>as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to</p>
<p>personalize your experience.</p>

<p>We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you</p>
<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>
<p>people, groups, and organizations they care about.</p>

<ul>
<li>for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across</li>
</ul>
<p>the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several</p>
<p>people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We</p>
<p>have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use</p>
<p>technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share</p>
<p>more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>community:</strong></p>
<p>People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We</p>
<p>employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced</p>
<p>technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct</p>
<p>towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or</p>
<p>protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we</p>
<p>will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing</p>
<p>content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an</p>
<p>account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other</p>
<p>Facebook Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by</p>
<p>someone using one of our Products.</p>

<p>We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that</p>
<p>people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or</p>
<p>geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who</p>
<p>have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos</p>
<p>shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network</p>
<p>and communication technology to help more people connect to the</p>
<p>internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems</p>
<p>to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous</p>
<p>activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.</p>

<p><strong>Research ways to make our services better:</strong></p>
<p>We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This</p>
<p>includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding</p>
<p>how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how</p>
<p>we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and</p>
<p>improving our services.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Company Products:</strong></p>
<p>Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our</p>
<p>systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use</p>
<p>data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for</p>
<p>you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you</p>
<p>to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through</p>
<p>Messenger.</p>

<p><strong>Enable global access to our services:</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content</p>
<p>and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including</p>
<p>outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or</p>
<p>controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.</p>

<ol>
<li>How our services are funded</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using</p>
<p>the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that</p>
<p>businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and</p>
<p>interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means</p>
<p>that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We</p>
<p>don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal,</p>
<p>and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age</p>
<p>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or</p>
<p>email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless</p>
<p>you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.</p>
<p>We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to</p>
<p>you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have</p>
<p>controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we</p>
<p>use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.</p>

<li>Your commitments to Facebook and</li>
</ol>
<p>our community</p>
<p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we</p>
<p>need you to make the following commitments:</p>
<p><strong>1. Who can use Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Who can use Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is</p>
<p>safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:</p>
<p>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</p>
<p>Provide accurate information about yourself.</p>
<p>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for</p>
<p>personal purposes.</p>
<p>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account</p>
<p>to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our</p>
<p>permission).</p>
<p>We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot</p>
<p>use Facebook if:</p>
<p>You are under 13 years old.</p>
<p>You are a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>We've previously disabled your account for violations of our</p>
<p>Terms or Policies.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or</p>
<p>software under applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>2. What you can share and do on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. What you can share and do on Facebook</strong></p>
<p>We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share</p>
<p>content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety</p>
<p>and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore</p>
<p>agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or</p>
<p>support others in doing so):</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</li>
</ol>
<p>That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and</p>
<p>other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.</p>
<p>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</p>
<p>That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including</p>
<p>their intellectual property rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that</li>
</ol>
<p>could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or</p>
<p>appearance of our Products.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to</p>
<p>access data you do not have permission to access.</p>
<p>We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p>If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community</p>
<p>Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request</p>
<p>another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or</p>
<p>if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community</p>
<p>of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of</p>
<p>our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to</p>
<p>technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal</p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or</p>
<p>conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual</p>
<p>property rights) or our terms and policies.</p>
<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that</li>
</ol>
<p>you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by</p>
<p>intellectual property laws.</p>
<p>You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or</p>
<p>trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on</p>
<p>Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own</p>
<p>content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,</p>
<p>wherever you want.</p>
<p>However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal</p>
<p>permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely</p>
<p>for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and</p>
<p>services as described in Section 1 above.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered</p>
<p>by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our</p>
<p>Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,</p>
<p>royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,</p>
<p>run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create</p>
<p>derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and</p>
<p>application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a</p>
<p>photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and</p>
<p>share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as</p>
<p>service providers that support our service or other Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted</p>
<p>from our systems.</p>
<p>You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your</p>
<p>account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can</p>
<p>download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your</p>
<p>account.</p>
<p>When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,</p>
<p>however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:</p>
<p>immediate deletion is not possible due to technical</p>
<p>limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted</p>
<p>within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);</p>
<p>your content has been used by others in accordance with</p>
<p>this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this</p>
<p>license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of</p>
<p>our terms and policies (for example, to identify or</p>
<p>investigate misuse of our Products or systems);</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the</p>
<p>preservation of evidence; or</p>
<p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative</p>
<p>authority, law enforcement or a government agency;</p>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is</p>
<p>necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the</p>
<p>exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the</p>
<p>content has been fully deleted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information</li>
</ol>
<p>about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us</p>
<p>permission to use your name and profile picture and information</p>
<p>about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection</p>
<p>with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display</p>
<p>across our Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an</p>
<p>advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen</p>
<p>only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've</p>
<p>taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and</p>
<p>preferences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to update software you use or download: If you</li>
</ol>
<p>download or use our software, you give us permission to download</p>
<p>and install updates to the software where available.</p>
<p><strong>4. Limits on using our intellectual property</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Limits on using our intellectual property</strong></p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have</p>
<p>and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos,</p>
<p>or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on</p>
<p>Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can</p>
<p>only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly</p>
<p>permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written</p>
<p>permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission</p>
<p>under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of,</p>
<p>decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.</p>

<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to</p>
<p>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we</p>
<p>may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect</p>
<p>our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will</p>
<p>notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an</p>
<p>opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated</p>
<p>Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not</p>
<p>agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the</p>
<p>Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Account suspension or termination</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Account suspension or termination</strong></p>
<p>We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to</p>
<p>express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached</p>
<p>our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards,</p>
<p>we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may</p>
<p>also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other</p>
<p>people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for</p>
<p>legal reasons.</p>
<p>Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options</p>
<p>you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to</p>
<p>legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere</p>
<p>with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or</p>
<p>Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or</p>
<p>where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been</p>
<p>disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your</p>
<p>account by mistake.</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as</p>
<p>an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will</p>
<p>remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.</p>
<p><strong>3. Limits on liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Limits on liability</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear</p>
<p>guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are</p>
<p>provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,</p>
<p>secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions,</p>
<p>delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,</p>
<p>INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS</p>
<p>FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do</p>
<p>not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not</p>
<p>responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or</p>
<p>any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,</p>
<p>unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by</p>
<p>applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any</p>
<p>lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or</p>
<p>related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been</p>
<p>advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising</p>
<p>out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not</p>
<p>exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p><strong>4. Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Disputes</strong></p>
<p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid</p>
<p>disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful</p>
<p>to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
<p>For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises</p>
<p>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you</p>
<p>agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the</p>
<p>Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo</p>
<p>County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of</p>
<p>these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the</p>
<p>laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,</p>
<p>without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

<p><strong>5. Other</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and</li>
</ol>
<p>Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede</p>
<p>any prior agreements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental</li>
</ol>
<p>terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be</p>
<p>made available and will become part of our agreement with you.</p>
<p>For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or</p>
<p>business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing</p>
<p>apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our</p>
<p>measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If</p>
<p>you post or share content containing music, you must comply with</p>
<p>our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms</p>
<p>conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to</p>
<p>the extent of the conflict.</p>
<ol>
<li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the</li>
</ol>
<p>remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to</p>
<p>enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any</p>
<p>amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing</p>
<p>and signed by us.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these</li>
</ol>
<p>Terms to anyone else without our consent.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage</li>
</ol>
<p>your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a</p>
<p>person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document</p>
<p>expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or</p>
<p>incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it</p>
<p>is memorialized.</p>
<ol>
<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of</li>
</ol>
<p>our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable</p>
<p>by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or</p>
<p>by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>You should know that we may need to change the username for</li>

<p>your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone</p>
<p>else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you</p>
<p>use in everyday life).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about</li>
</ol>
<p>our products and services. But you should know that we may use</p>
