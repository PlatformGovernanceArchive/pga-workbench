Date of Last Revision: January 30, 2015

**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with<span style="background-color: red;"> users and others who</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">users and others who </span>interact with Facebook, as well as Facebook brands, products and services, which we call the “Facebook Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Facebook Services, you agree to this Statement,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>that help you understand how Facebook works.

Because Facebook provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>To the extent those<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>product or service to the extent of the conflict.

1. **Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect<span style="background-color: red;"> and can use your</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and can use your </span>content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions. 

 

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> and application</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and application </span>settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>connection with Facebook (IP License).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>backup copies for a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>shared with you. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>that content and information. (To learn<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that<span style="background-color: red;"> information, and to</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">information, and to </span>associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation<span style="background-color: red;"> to compensate you</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">to compensate you </span>for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

 

3. **Safety**

1. You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.

2. You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers)<span style="background-color: red;"> without our prior</span>

10. You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack or interference<span style="background-color: red;"> with page rendering or</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">with page rendering or </span>other Facebook functionality.

11. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.

 

4. **Registration and Account Security**

Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and<span style="background-color: red;"> maintaining the</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">security of your </span>account.

9. You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.

10. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>trademark owner<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.

1. You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.
