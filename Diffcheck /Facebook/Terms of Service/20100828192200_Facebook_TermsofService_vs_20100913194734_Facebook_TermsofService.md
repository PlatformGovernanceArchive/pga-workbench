**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>interact with Facebook. By using or<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.

1. **Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with<span style="background-color: red;"> others and how we collect and can use</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">others and how we collect and can use </span>your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>decisions.

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>any IP content that you post on or in connection with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>content may persist in backup<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application. We require applications to respect your privacy, and<span style="background-color: red;"> your agreement with that</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">your agreement with that </span>application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. (To learn more<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>about Platform, read our Privacy Policy and About Platform<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

<span style="background-color: green;">to access and use that </span>information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>promotion, and will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws.
