<p>Date of Last Revision: August 28, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this</p>
<p>Statement.</p>
<p><strong>1. Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how</p>
<p>you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We</p>
<p>encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></p>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through</p>
<p>your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you</li>
</ol>
<p>specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us</p>
<p>a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that</p>
<p>you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP</p>
<p>content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of</p>
<p>time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the</li>
</ol>
<p>application. We require applications to respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that</p>
<p>application will control how the application can use the content and information you share. (To learn more</p>
<p>about Platform, read our About Platform page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone, including</li>
</ol>
<p>people off of Facebook, will have access to that information and we may not have control over what they</p>
<p>do with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we</li>
</ol>
<p>may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer</p>
<p>them).</p>
<p><strong>3. Safety</strong></p>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which</p>
<p>includes the following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>

<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>

<p>You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>gratuitous violence.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise market</li>
</ol>
<p>alcohol-related or other mature content without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes ("promotion") on Facebook without our prior</li>
</ol>
<p>written consent. If we consent, you take full responsibility for the promotion, and will follow our</p>
<p>Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>

<p>You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to</p>
<p>a user's actual name).</p>
<p><strong>5. Protecting Other People's Rights</strong></p>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</p>
