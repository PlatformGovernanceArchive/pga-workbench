<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this</p>
<p>Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about</p>
<p>how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and</p>
<p>information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared</p>
<p>through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"),</li>
</ol>
<p>you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings:</p>
<p>you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use</p>
<p>any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends</p>
<p>when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others,</p>
<p>and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a</li>
</ol>
<p>computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a</p>
<p>reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the</li>
</ol>
<p>application. We require applications to respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that</p>
<p>application will control how the application can use the content and information you share. (To learn</p>
<p>more about Platform, read our About Platform page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone,</li>
</ol>
<p>including people off of Facebook, will have access to that information and we may not have control</p>
<p>over what they do with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand</li>
</ol>
<p>that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no</p>
<p>obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which</p>
<p>includes the following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated</li>
</ol>
<p>means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>graphic or gratuitous violence.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise</li>
</ol>
<p>market alcohol-related or other mature content without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes ("promotion") on Facebook without our</li>
</ol>
<p>prior written consent. If we consent, you take full responsibility for the promotion, and will follow</p>
<p>our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Facebook,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>such as a denial of service attack.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Registration and Account Security</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here</p>
<p>are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone</li>
</ol>
<p>other than yourself without permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not use your personal profile for your own commercial gain (such as selling your status</li>
</ol>
<p>update to an advertiser).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not share your password, let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>might jeopardize the security of your account.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely</p>
<p>relate to a user's actual name).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Protecting Other People's Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else's</li>
</ol>
<p>rights or otherwise violates the law.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this</li>
</ol>
<p>Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>We will provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more,</li>
</ol>
<p>visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page.</p>
<ol>
<li>If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it</li>
</ol>
<p>by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account</li>
</ol>
<p>when appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB,</li>

<p>Face, Poke, Wall and 32665), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission.</p>

</ol>
