<p><span style="background-color: red;">The "Facebook Platform" is a set of APIs and services that third parties may use to (a) create applications for use on</p>
<p>the Facebook Service ("Applications") and (b) enable their websites to work like Applications ("Connect Sites")</p>
<p>through Facebook Connect ("Connect"). Applications and Connect Sites will be referred to together as</p>
<p>"Applications/Connect Sites," which should be read as Applications and/or Connect Sites.</p>
<p>If you authorize an Application or allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you</p>
<p>agree that such Application/Connect Site can (a) access information on the Facebook Service related to you</p>
<p>(including your profile information, friends and privacy settings) and (b) generate and publish news feed and other</p>
<p>stories about actions you take on such Application/Connect Site without any additional permission. If you want to</p>
<p>change the information that Applications/Connect Sites can access, you may modify your privacy settings. If you no</p>
<p>longer want these news feed or other stories to be published, you can disable this feature by changing your</p>
<p>application settings. If you, your friends or members of your network use any Application/Connect Site, such</p>
<p>Applications/Connect Sites may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your</p>
<p>privacy settings.</p>
<p>Once you allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you will be able to use your</p>
<p>login information for the Facebook Service to log into and interact with your friends on that Connect Site. In order to</p>
<p>make Connect possible, you agree to allow us to check your cookies for the Facebook Service when you are visiting</p>
<p>Connect Sites. When your friends connect their account on the Facebook Service with a Connect Site, Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find friends on the Facebook Service that may also be users of that Connect Site and invite them to</p>
<p>use Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you to connect on a Connect Site, you may</p>
<p>change your privacy settings to disable this feature. Even if you have not gone through the Connect process, you</p>
<p>may be able to authorize a Connect Site to generate and publish news feed and other stories about an action or all</p>
<p>actions that you take on that Connect Site. If you want to change your settings for that Connect Site, visit your</p>
<p>application settings.</p>
<p><strong>Your Privacy Practices</strong></p>
<p>We respect the privacy rights of third parties, and you must do so as well on the Facebook Service.</p>
<p>If you collect, access or use information relating to any user of the Facebook Service (including information</p>
<p>contained in any user profile) you must obtain consent from the user and make it clear to the user that the</p>
<p>collection, access and use is being carried out by you and not Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Gift Credits</strong></p>
<p>You must be authorized to use the credit card, debit card or other payment source ("Card") you provide to purchase</p>
<p>gift credits. By purchasing gift credits, you authorize Facebook or its designated payment processor to charge the</p>
<p>purchase amount (plus any applicable tax) to your Card. By providing your Card account information to Facebook,</p>
<p>you authorize us to collect and store it and other related transaction information.</p>
<p>When you purchase gift credits, you are purchasing only a limited license to use certain features on the Facebook</p>
<p>Service that will enhance your experience on the Facebook Service, such as giving virtual gifts to your friends. Gift</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Connect ("Connect") enables participating third party websites to work just like Facebook Platform</p>
<p>applications. Once you allow a third party website to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook</p>
<p>login information to log into that website. The third party website will be able to: generate and publish news feed</p>
<p>and other stories about actions you take on their website; access Facebook information related to you (including</p>
<p>your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the third party</p>
<p>site; and allow you to interact with your friends on the website. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to</p>
<p>allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting participating third party websites, and allow</p>
<p>Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on those third party websites. In addition, once</p>
<p>you allow a participating third party website to connect with Facebook, you agree to allow Facebook and such third</p>
<p>party website to generate and publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on the website without</p>
<p>any additional permission. In the event you no longer want the third party website to publish stories about you, you</p>
<p>can always disable this feature by changing your application settings.</p>
<p>When your friends connect their Facebook account with a participating third party website, Facebook Connect will</p>

<p>Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you, you may change your privacy settings to</p>

<p>Connect also gives you the ability to permit Facebook and participating third party websites to generate and publish</p>
<p>news feed and other stories about actions you have taken on such websites, even if you have not gone through the</p>

<p>that website, visit your application settings.</p>
<p>Like Platform Applications, third party websites that participate in Connect are required, among other things, to</p>
<p>protect your privacy consistent with your Facebook privacy settings and Facebook's privacy policy.</p>
