<p>Date of Last Revision: November 15, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance</p>
<p>with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we</p>
<p>collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your</li>
</ol>
<p>privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post</p>
<p>on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with</p>
<p>others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may</li>
</ol>
<p>persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others</li>
</ol>
<p>have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,</p>
<p>and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with</p>
<p>applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use</li>
</ol>
<p>that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you</li>
</ol>
<p>for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which includes the following commitments by you:</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>without our prior permission.</p>

<p>responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, or any user of Facebook.</p>

<p>CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO</p>
<p>EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE</p>
<p>DEBTOR. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT</p>

<p>LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS STATEMENT OR FACEBOOK WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE</p>
<p>PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR</p>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
