<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Facebook! </p>
<p>Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to</p>
<p>connect with each other, build communities, and grow businesses.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the</p>
<p>other products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software</p>
<p>we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we</p>
<p>expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These</p>
<p>Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p>We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and</p>
<p>services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and</p>
<p>organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services.</p>
<p>By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we</p>
<p>think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal</p>
<p>data to help determine which ads to show you. </p>
<p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share</p>
<p>information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email</p>
<p>address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give</p>
<p>us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to</p>
<p>people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports</p>
<p>about the performance of their ads that help them understand how</p>
<p>people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn</p>
<p>more. </p>
<p>Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data</p>
<p>to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other</p>
<p>services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time</p>
<p>to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.</p>

<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as</p>
<p>Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize</p>
<p>your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Connect you with people and organizations you care about:</strong></p>
<p>We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you</p>
<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>
<p>people, groups, and organizations they care about.</p>
<p><strong>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what</strong></p>
<p><strong>matters to you:</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to</p>
<p>communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you -</p>
<p>for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across</p>
<p>the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several</p>
<p>people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We</p>
<p>have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use</p>
<p>technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share</p>
<p>more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest</strong></p>
<p><strong>you:</strong></p>
<p>We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you</p>
<p>discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many</p>
<p>businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook</p>
<p>Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:</strong></p>
<p>People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ</p>
<p>dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical</p>
<p>systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others,</p>
<p>and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our</p>
<p>community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take</p>
<p>appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing</p>
<p>or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or</p>
<p>contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook</p>
<p>Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using</p>
<p>one of our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and</strong></p>
<p><strong>functional services for everyone:</strong></p>
<p>We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that</p>
<p>people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or</p>
<p>geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who</p>
<p>have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos</p>
<p>shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network</p>
<p>and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet</p>
<p>in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to</p>
<p>improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity</p>
<p>that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Research ways to make our services better:</strong></p>
<p>We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This</p>
<p>includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding</p>
<p>how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and</p>
<p>testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we</p>
<p>use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and</p>
<p>improving our services.</p>

<li>How our services are funded</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using</p>
<p>the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that</p>
<p>businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and</p>
<p>interests, </span>to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means</p>
<p>that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We</p>
<p>don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal,</p>
<p>and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age</p>
<p>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>email</span> <span style="background-color: green;">email</p>
<p></span>address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>you give<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to</p>
<p>you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have</p>
<p>controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we</p>
<p>need you to make the following commitments:</p>
<p><strong>1. Who can use Facebook</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is</p>
<p>safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:</p>
<p>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</p>
<p>Provide accurate information about yourself.</p>
<p>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for</p>
<p>personal purposes.</p>
<p>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account</p>
<p>to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our</p>
<p>permission).</p>
<p>We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot</p>
<p>use Facebook if:</p>
<p>You are under 13 years old.</p>
<p>You are a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms</p>
<p>or Policies.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or</p>
<p>software under applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>2. What you can share and do on Facebook</strong></p>
<p>We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share</p>
<p>content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and</p>
<p>well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree</p>
<p>not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support</p>
<p>others in doing so):</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</li>
</ol>
<p>That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and</p>
<p>other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.</p>
<p>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</p>
<p>That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including</p>
<p>their intellectual property rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that</li>
</ol>
<p>could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or</p>
<p>appearance of our Products.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to</p>
<p>access data you do not have permission to access.</p>
<p>We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p>If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community</p>
<p>Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request</p>
<p>Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request</p>
<p>another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if</p>
<p>doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of</p>
<p>users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our</p>
<p>services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical</p>
<p>limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or</p>
<p>conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property</p>
<p>rights) or our terms and policies.</p>
<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>

<p>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you</p>

<p>Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo</p>
<p>County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of</p>
<p>these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>laws</span> <span style="background-color: green;">laws</p>
<p></span>of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>without</span> <span style="background-color: red;">regard to conflict of la</span>w<span style="background-color: red;"> prov</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">sions.</p>
