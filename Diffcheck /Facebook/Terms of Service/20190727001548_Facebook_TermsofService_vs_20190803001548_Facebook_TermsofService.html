<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>Welcome to Facebook! </p>
<p>Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to</p>
<p>connect with each other, build communities, and grow businesses.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other</p>
<p>products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer</p>
<p>(the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state</p>
<p>that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are</p>
<p>provided to you by Facebook, Inc. </p>
<p>We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and</p>
<p>services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organizations</p>
<p>pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our</p>
<p>Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be</p>
<p>relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help</p>
<p>determine which ads to show you. </p>
<p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share</p>
<p>information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email</p>
<p>address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give</p>
<p>us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the</p>
<p>kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to</p>
<p>people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports</p>
<p>about the performance of their ads that help them understand how</p>
<p>people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn</p>
<p>more. </p>
<p>Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to</p>
<p>determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services</p>
<p>described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review</p>
<p>the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.</p>

<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p></span>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such</p>
<p>as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to</p>
<p>personalize your experience.</p>

<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>

<p>People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We</p>

<p>technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct</p>
<p>towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or</p>
<p>protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we</p>
<p>will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing</p>

<p>geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who</p>
<p>have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos</p>
<p>shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network</p>
<p>and communication technology to help more people connect to the</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Company Products:</strong></p>
<p>Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our</p>
<p>systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use</p>
<p>data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for</p>
<p>you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you</p>

<li><span style="background-color: red;">O</span><span style="background-color: green;">How our services are funded</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using</p>
<p>the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that</p>
<p>businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company</p>
<p>Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and</p>
<p>interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means</p>
<p>that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We</p>
<p>don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal,</p>
<p>and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age</p>
<p>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them</p>
<p>understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For</p>
<p>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for</p>
<p>example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in</p>
<p>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.</p>
<p>We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or</p>
<p>email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless</p>
<p>you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.</p>

<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to</p>
<p>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we</p>
<p>may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect</p>
<p>our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will</p>
<p>notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an</p>

<p>Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not</p>

<p>If we determine that you have <span style="background-color: green;">clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached</p>

<p><strong>3. Limits on liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Limits on liability</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear</p>
<p>guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are</p>
<p>provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,</p>
<p>secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions,</p>
<p>delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also</p>
<p>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,</p>
<p>INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS</p>
<p>FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do</p>
<p>not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not</p>
<p>responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or</p>
<p>any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,</p>
<p>unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by</p>
<p>applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any</p>
<p>lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,</p>
<p>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or</p>
<p>related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been</p>
<p>advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising</p>
<p>out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not</p>
<p>exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past</p>
<p>twelve months.</p>
<p><strong>4. Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Disputes</strong></p>
<p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid</p>
<p>disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful</p>
<p>to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
<p>For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises</p>
<p>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you</p>
<p>agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the</p>
<p>Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo</p>
<p>County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of</p>
<p>these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the</p>
<p>laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,</p>
<p>without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental</li>
</ol>
<p>terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be</p>
<p>made available and will become part of our agreement with you.</p>
<p>For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or</p>
<p>business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing</p>
<p>apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our</p>
<p>measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If</p>
<p>you post or share content containing music, you must comply with</p>
<p>our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms</p>

<p>the extent of the conflict.</p>

<p>enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any</p>
<p>amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing</p>
