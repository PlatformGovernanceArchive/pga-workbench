<p></span><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. </p>
<p>Please note that Section 17 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.</p>
<p>Date of Last Revision: December 11, 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in</p>
<p>accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how</p>
<p>we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to</li>
</ol>
<p>your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content</p>
<p>that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content</p>
<p>has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content</li>
</ol>
<p>may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that</li>
</ol>
<p>others have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application</p>
<p>can use, store, and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people</p>
<p>may share with applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access</li>
</ol>
<p>and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to</li>
</ol>
<p>compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which includes the following commitments by you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>scrapers) without our prior permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>

<p>Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>

<p>registering and maintaining the security of your account:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>jeopardize the security of your account.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Protecting Other People's Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies.</p>

<p>We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Infringement page.</p>

<li>If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to</li>
</ol>
<p>appeal.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Book and Wall), or any confusingly similar</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Facebook) are the one collecting their information, and</li>
</ol>
<p>post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on Facebook.</p>
</li>

<p>You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent. Facebook offers social reporting tools to enable users to provide</p>

</ol>
<p>feedback about tagging.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging fees, will still</p>

<p>You will resolve any claim, cause of action or dispute (claim) you have with us arising out of or relating to this Statement or Facebook exclusively in a</p>

<p>WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM</p>
<p>MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR OTHER</p>

<p>WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. APPLICABLE</p>
<p>LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR</p>
<p>EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, FACEBOOK'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE</p>
