<p>represents and warrants that such web site does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing, harmful,</p>
<p>threatening, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent, or invasive of</p>
<p>privacy or publicity rights or that may expose Company or its Users to any harm or liability of any type. Upon including of</p>
<p>a Share Link, Online Content Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and</p>
<p>each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss,</p>
<p>liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in</p>
<p>connection with such Share Link, any links, content or other items or materials which may be shared or posted through</p>
<p>such Share Link, or any breach or alleged breach of the foregoing representations and warranties. </p>
<p>By including a Share Link, Online Content Provider automatically grants, and represents and warrants that it has the right</p>
<p>to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the</p>
<p>right to sublicense) to use the Share Service in order to link to, use, copy, publish, stream, publicly perform, publicly</p>
<p>display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), summarize, and distribute the content, links and other materials</p>
