<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>2. How our services are funded<span style="background-color: red;">**</span>

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using

the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that

businesses and organi<span style="background-color: red;">s</span><span style="background-color: green;">z</span>ations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company

Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>interests,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means

that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We

don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things <span style="background-color: green;">l</span><span style="background-color: red;">such as the</span>i<span style="background-color: green;">k</span><span style="background-color: red;">r busin</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> their bu</span>s<span style="background-color: green;">ine</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">

</span><span style="background-color: green;">s </span>goal,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>and the kind of audience th<span style="background-color: red;">at th</span>ey want to see their ads (for example, people between<span style="background-color: red;">

the</span> <span style="background-color: red;">ag</span><span style="background-color: green;">th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">s</span> <span style="background-color: green;">age

</span>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them

understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For

example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for

example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in

Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>don<span style="background-color: green;">’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or

email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless

you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to

you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have

controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we

use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by

intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our

Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,

royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,

run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create

derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and

application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a

photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and

share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as

service providers that support our service or other Facebook

Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted

from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your

account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your

account.

When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,

however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted

within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with

this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this

license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);

or

where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

our terms and policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the

exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

</span>In e<span style="background-color: green;">ach of the above cases, this license will continue until the

content has been fully deleted.

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content

that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be

protected by intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘licence') to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products,

you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-

free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy,

publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of

your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you

give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support

our service or other Facebook Products you use.This licence will end

when your content is deleted from our systems.

however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with this

licence and they have not deleted it (in which case, this

licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or

Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of

our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact

duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content

has been fully deleted.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about

your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in

connection with ads, offers and other sponsored content that we

display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For

example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an

advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has

paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen

only by people who have your permission to see the actions that

you've taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad

settings and preferences.

3. Permission to update software that you use or download: If you

download or use our software, you give us permission to download

and install updates to the software where available.

<span style="background-color: green;">**4. Disputes**

</span>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid

disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful

to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

For any claim, cause of action<span style="background-color: red;"> or dispute that you have against us</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">o</span><span style="background-color: red;">which

a</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">ises</span> <span style="background-color: green;">dispute you have against us that arises

</span>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"),<span style="background-color: red;">

you</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you

</span>agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U<span style="background-color: green;">.</span>S<span style="background-color: green;">.</span> District Court for the

Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo

<span style="background-color: green;">Northern District of </span>C<span style="background-color: green;">alifornia or a state court located in San Mateo

C</span>ounty. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of

these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the<span style="background-color: red;"> laws</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">laws </span>of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,<span style="background-color: red;"> without</span>

**5. Other**

<span style="background-color: red;">1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and

Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and

Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede

any prior agreements.

2. Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by

supplemental Terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental

terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement

with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for

commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling

products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your

business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our

Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music,

you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent that any

supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental

Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.

3. If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the

remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to

enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any

amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and

signed by us.

4. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these

Terms to anyone else without our consent.

5. You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage

your account if it is memorialised. Only your legacy contact or a

person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document

expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or

incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is

memorialised.

6. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of

our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable

by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by

operation of law or otherwise.

7. You should know that we may need to change the username for your

account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else

claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name that you

use in everyday life).

8. We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about

our products and services. But you should know that we may use

them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we

are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

9. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
