Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer

together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described

below to you:

**Provide a personalized experience for you:**

**Provide a personalized experience for you:**

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,

stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video

platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such

as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for

example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you

select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to

personalize your experience.

**Connect you with people and organizations you care about:**

**Connect you with people and organizations you care about:**

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook

Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you

and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow

or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to

become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we

believe our services are most useful when people are connected to

people, groups, and organizations they care about.

**matters to you:**

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to

communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you

- for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across

the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several

people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We

also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use

technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share

more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.

We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you

discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many

businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook

Products. Our partners pay us to show their content to you, and we

design our services so that the sponsored content you see is as relevant

**community:**

People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We

employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced

technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct

towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or

protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we

will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing

content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or

contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook

Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone

using one of our Products.

**functional services for everyone:**

We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial

intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that

people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or

geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who

have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos

shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network

and communication technology to help more people connect to the

internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems

to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous

activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

**Facebook Company Products:**

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our

systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the

different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use

data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for

you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you

to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through

Messenger.

**Enable global access to our services:**

**Enable global access to our services:**

To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content

and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including

permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that

support our service or other Facebook Products you use.

You can end this license any time by deleting your content or

account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you

delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies

you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others

content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and

well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree

not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support

others in doing so):

1. You may not use our Products to do or share anything:

That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and

other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.

That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.

That infringes or violates someone else's rights.

2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that

could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or

appearance of our Products.

3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using

automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to

access data you do not have permission to access.

We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if

applicable, we may take action against your account, for the reasons

described below. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly

infringe other people's intellectual property rights.

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or

conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property

rights) or our terms and policies.

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: You own the

content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook

Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights

you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with

anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we

need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in

connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,

transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to

host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,

translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with

your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that

if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store,

copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings)

such as service providers that support our service or other

Facebook Products you use.

You can end this license any time by deleting your content or

account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you

delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies

(though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you

delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and

they have not deleted it.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about

your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection

with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across

our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we

may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event

or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display

its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who

have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.

You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.

If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a parent

or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your behalf. (This

language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal settlement.)

3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you download

or use our software, you give us permission to download and install

upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance,

and further develop it.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and

make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or

sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on

Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only

use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under

an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile,

or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

**4. Additional provisions**

**1. Updating our Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to

make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may

need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our

services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you

before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to

review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in

effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree

to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook

community, you can delete your account at any time.</span>

**2. Account suspension or termination**

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to

express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take

action against your account to protect our community and services,

including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may

also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure

for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where

appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try<span style="background-color: red;"> to</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">to </span>access it. You can learn more about what you can do if your account<span style="background-color: red;"> has</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">has </span>been disabled.

If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as<span style="background-color: red;"> an</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">an </span>agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will<span style="background-color: red;"> remain in</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">remain in </span>place: 3, 4.2-4.5

**3. Limits on liability**

<span style="background-color: green;">**3. Limits on liability**

</span>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear

guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are

provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,

<span style="background-color: green;">provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,

</span>secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions,<span style="background-color: red;"> delays, or</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">delays, or </span>imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>DISCLAIM ALL<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>INCLUDING THE<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>FOR A<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do<span style="background-color: red;"> not</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">not </span>control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not

responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or<span style="background-color: red;"> any</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">any </span>content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,<span style="background-color: red;"> unlawful,</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">unlawful, </span>and other objectionable content).

We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Accordingly,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by<span style="background-color: red;"> applicable law,</span>

a<span style="background-color: red;">nd under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost </span>p<span style="background-color: green;">pl</span><span style="background-color: red;">rof</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">ts</span><span style="background-color: green;">cable law</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">lost profits, </span>revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,<span style="background-color: red;"> indirect,</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">indirect, </span>exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or<span style="background-color: red;"> related to</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">related to </span>these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>advised of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising<span style="background-color: red;"> out of or</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">out of or </span>relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>exceed the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>twelve months.

**4. Disputes**

<span style="background-color: green;">**4. Disputes**

</span>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid

disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful

to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises

out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you

agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the

Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo

County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of

these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the<span style="background-color: red;"> laws</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">laws </span>of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,<span style="background-color: red;"> without</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">without </span>regard to conflict of law provisions.

**5. Other**

<span style="background-color: red;">1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and

Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and

Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede

any prior agreements.

2. Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental

terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be

made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For

instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or

business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing

apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our

measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If

you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our

Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with

these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the

conflict.

3. If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the

remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to

enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any

amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and

signed by us.

4. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these

Terms to anyone else without our consent.

5. You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage

your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a

person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document

expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or

incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is

memorialized.

6. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of

our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable

our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable

by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or

by operation of law or otherwise.

7. You should know that we may need to change the username for your

account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else

claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use

in everyday life).

8. We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about

our products and services. But you should know that we may use

them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we

are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

9. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
