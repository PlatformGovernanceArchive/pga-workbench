**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>interact with Facebook. By using or accessing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will<span style="background-color: red;">

find</span> <span style="background-color: red;">resources at the end o</span>f<span style="background-color: green;">ind</span> <span style="background-color: green;">resources at the end of

</span>this document that help you understand how Facebook works.

1. **Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>content and information. We encourage you to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

 

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>settings: you grant us a non-exclusive,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>connection with Facebook (IP License).<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: red;"> reasonable period of time</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">reasonable period of time </span>(but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>information as well as content and information that others have shared with you. We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>require applications to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and transfer that content and information. (To learn<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>more about Platform, including how you can control what<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>information other people may share with applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>associate it with you (i.e., your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>have no obligation to offer them).
