<p></span>Please<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>note that Section 17 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.</p>
<p>Date of Last Revision: December 11, 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in<span style="background-color: red;"> accordance</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">accordance </span>with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">1. </span><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how<span style="background-color: red;"> we</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">we </span>collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">2. </span><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></p>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">your </span>privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content<span style="background-color: red;"> that you post</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">that you post </span>on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content<span style="background-color: red;"> has been shared with</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">has been shared with </span>others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content<span style="background-color: red;"> may</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">may </span>persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that<span style="background-color: red;"> others</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">others </span>have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>can use, store,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people<span style="background-color: red;"> may share with</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">may share with </span>applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access<span style="background-color: red;"> and use</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">and use </span>that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to<span style="background-color: red;"> compensate you</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">compensate you </span>for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">3. </span><strong>Safety</strong></p>
