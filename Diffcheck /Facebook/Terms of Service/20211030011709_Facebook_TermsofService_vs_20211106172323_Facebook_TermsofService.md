<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>1. The services we provide<span style="background-color: green;">**</span>

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world

closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services

described below to you:

**Provide a personalized experience for you:**

<span style="background-color: green;">Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,

stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video

platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as

Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for

example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you

select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize

your experience.

**Connect you with people and organizations you care about:**

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook

Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you

and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow

or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to

become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we

believe our services are most useful when people are connected to

people, groups, and organizations they care about.

**Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what**

**matters to you:**

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to

communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you -

for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across

the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several

people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We

have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use

technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share

more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.

**Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest**

**you:**

We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you

discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many

businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook

Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

**Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:**

People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ

dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical

systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others,

and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our

community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take

appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing

or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or

contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook

Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using

one of our Products.

**Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and**

**functional services for everyone:**

**functional services for everyone:**

We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial

intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that

people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or

geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who

have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos

shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network

and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet

in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to

improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity

that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

**Research ways to make our services better:**

We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This

includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding

how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and

testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how we

use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and

improving our services.

2. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by

using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show

you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the

Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information

about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This

means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers

who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things

like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for

example, </span>people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad<span style="background-color: red;">

to</span> <span style="background-color: green;">t</span><span style="background-color: red;">pe</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ple</span> <span style="background-color: green;">people

</span>who might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to<span style="background-color: red;">

help</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span>he<span style="background-color: red;">m understand how peop</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">p</span><span style="background-color: red;">e are interacting with their content on and off</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off </span>Facebook.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>For example, we provide general demographic and interest information<span style="background-color: green;"> to</span>

F<span style="background-color: red;">acebook. F</span>or example, we provide general demographic and interest information<span style="background-color: red;">

to</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to

</span>advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>25<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better

understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you

(information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to<span style="background-color: red;">

contact</span> <span style="background-color: green;">contact

</span>you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn<span style="background-color: red;">

more</span> <span style="background-color: green;">more

</span>about how Facebook ads work here.

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described

above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data

Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the

types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In

exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

**1. Who can use Facebook**

<span style="background-color: green;">When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is

safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

Use the same name that you use in everyday life.

Provide accurate information about yourself.

Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for

personal purposes.

Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account

to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our

permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot

use Facebook if:

You are under 13 years old.

You are a convicted sex offender.

We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms

or Policies.

You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or

software under applicable laws.

**2. What you can share and do on Facebook**

We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share

content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and

well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree

not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support

others in doing so):

1. You may not use our Products to do or share anything:

That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and

other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.

That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.

That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including

That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including

their intellectual property rights.

2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that

could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or

appearance of our Products.

3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using

automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to

access data you do not have permission to access.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these

provisions.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community

Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request

another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if

doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of

users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our

services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical

limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or

conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property

rights) or our terms and policies.

We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or

information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid

or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that

you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by

intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products,

you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-

free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy,

publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of

your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you

give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support

our service or other Facebook Products you use.This license will end

when your content is deleted from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your

account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your

account.

When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,

however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within

a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with this

license and they have not deleted it (in which case this

license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or

where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

our terms and policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact

duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content

has been fully deleted.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about

your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection

with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across

our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we

may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event

or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display

its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who

have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.

You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.

3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you download

or use our software, you give us permission to download and install

updates to the software where available.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and

make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or

sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on

Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only

use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

**3. The permissions you give us**

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that

you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by

intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or

trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,

wherever you want.

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal

permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and

services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our

Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,

royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,

run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create

derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and

application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a

photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and

share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as

service providers that support our service or other Facebook

Products you use.This license will end when your content is deleted

from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your

account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your

account.

When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,

however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical

limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted

within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with

this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this

license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);

or

where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of

our terms and policies (for example, to identify or

investigate misuse of our Products or systems);

comply with a legal obligation, such as the

preservation of evidence; or

comply with a request of a judicial or administrative

authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is

necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the

exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the

content has been fully deleted.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information

about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection

with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display

across our Products, without any compensation to you. For

example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an

advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has

paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen

only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've

taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and

preferences.

3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you

download or use our software, you give us permission to download

and install updates to the software where available.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have

and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos,

or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on

Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can

only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission

under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of,

decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

**1. Updating our Terms**

**1. Updating our Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to

make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we

may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect

our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will

notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an

opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated

Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our

Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not

agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the

Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.

**2. Account suspension or termination**

**2. Account suspension or termination**

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to

express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached

our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards,

we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may

also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other

people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for

legal reasons.

Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options

you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to

legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere

with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or

Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or

where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been

disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your

account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as

an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will

remain in </span>place: 3, 4.2-4.5.

**3. Limits on liability**

<span style="background-color: red;">**3. Limits on liability**

</span>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear

guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are

provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,

secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>FOR A<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do<span style="background-color: red;">

not</span> <span style="background-color: green;">not

</span>control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not

responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or<span style="background-color: red;">

any</span> <span style="background-color: green;">any

</span>content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>unlawful,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>and other objectionable content).

We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Accordingly,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>applicable law,<span style="background-color: red;"> and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any </span>lost profits,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

advised</span> <span style="background-color: red;">of</span><span style="background-color: green;">advised</span> <span style="background-color: green;">of

</span>the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising<span style="background-color: red;">

Disput</span>e<span style="background-color: green;"> try to provide clear rule</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">**</span><span style="background-color: green;"> so that we can limit or hopefully avoid</span>

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid

disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful

to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises

out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you

agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the

Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo

County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of

these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the<span style="background-color: red;">

laws</span> <span style="background-color: green;">laws

</span>of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,<span style="background-color: red;">

without</span> <span style="background-color: green;">without

</span>regard to conflict of law provisions.

**5. Other**

<span style="background-color: green;">1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and

Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and

Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede

any prior agreements.

2. Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental

terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be

made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For

instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or

business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing

apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our

measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If

you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our

Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with

these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the

conflict.

3. If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the

remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to

enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any

amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and

signed by us.

4. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these

Terms to anyone else without our consent.

5. You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage

your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a

person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document

expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or

incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is

memorialized.

6. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of

our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable

by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or

by operation of law or otherwise.

7. You should know that we may need to change the username for your

account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else

claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use

in everyday life).

8. We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about

our products and services. But you should know that we may use

them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we

are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

9. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
