<p><strong>User Content</strong></p>
<p>By using or accessing the Facebook Service, you represent, warrant and agree that you will not Post:</p>
<p>User Content that violates the law or anyone's rights, including intellectual property ("IP") rights or other</p>

<p>rights. When we receive a proper claim of IP infringement, we promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly</p>
<p>infringing User Content. We also terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. If you</p>
<p>believe that User Content on the Facebook Service infringes your IP rights, please visit our How to Report Claims of</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Infringement page. All IP claims can be made through that page, including any copyright claims,</p>
<p>which will be handled in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you are a user whose User Content</p>
<p>was removed due to alleged copyright infringement, and you believe the removal was mistaken, please visit our How</p>
<p>to Appeal Claims of Copyright Infringement page.</p>

<p>There are features of the Facebook Service that may be accessible via certain mobile carriers (the "Mobile</p>
<p>Services"). While we currently do not charge for these Mobile Services, your carrier's normal messaging, data and</p>
<p>other rates and fees will still apply. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we may communicate with you by</p>
<p>SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device, and that certain information about your</p>
<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>

<p>usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile</p>
<p>telephone number, you agree to promptly update your account information on the Facebook Service to ensure that</p>
<p>your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Applications and Connect Sites</strong></p>
<p>The "Facebook Platform" is a set of APIs and services that third parties may use to (a) create applications for use on</p>
<p>the Facebook Service ("Applications") and (b) enable their websites to work like Applications ("Connect Sites")</p>
<p>through Facebook Connect ("Connect"). Applications and Connect Sites will be referred to together as</p>
<p>"Applications/Connect Sites," which should be read as Applications and/or Connect Sites.</p>
<p>If you authorize an Application or allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you</p>
<p>agree that such Application/Connect Site can (a) access information on the Facebook Service related to you</p>
<p>(including your profile information, friends and privacy settings) and (b) generate and publish news feed and other</p>
<p>stories about actions you take on such Application/Connect Site without any additional permission. If you want to</p>
<p>change the information that Applications/Connect Sites can access, you may modify your privacy settings. If you no</p>
<p>longer want these news feed or other stories to be published, you can disable this feature by changing your</p>
<p>application settings. If you, your friends or members of your network use any Application/Connect Site, such</p>
<p>Applications/Connect Sites may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your</p>
<p>privacy settings.</p>
<p>Once you allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you will be able to use your</p>
<p>login information for the Facebook Service to log into and interact with your friends on that Connect Site. In order to</p>
<p>make Connect possible, you agree to allow us to check your cookies for the Facebook Service when you are visiting</p>
<p>Connect Sites. When your friends connect their account on the Facebook Service with a Connect Site, Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find friends on the Facebook Service that may also be users of that Connect Site and invite them to</p>
<p>use Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you to connect on a Connect Site, you may</p>
<p>change your privacy settings to disable this feature. </span>E<span style="background-color: green;">ven if you have not gone through the Connect process, you</p>
<p>may be able to authorize a Connect Site to generate and publish news feed and other stories about an action or all</p>
<p>actions that you take on that Connect Site. If you want to change your settings for that Connect Site, visit your</p>
<p>application settings.</p>
<p><strong>Your Privacy Practices</strong></p>
<p>We respect the privacy rights of third parties, and you must do so as well on the Facebook Service.</p>
<p>If you collect, access or use information relating to any user of the Facebook Service (including information</p>
<p>contained in any user profile) you must obtain consent from the user and make it clear to the user that the</p>
<p>collection, access and use is being carried out by you and not Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Gift Credits</strong></p>
<p>You must be authorized to use the credit card, debit card or other payment source ("Card") you provide to purchase</p>
<p>gift credits. By purchasing gift credits, you authorize Facebook or its designated payment processor to charge the</p>
<p>purchase amount (plus any applicable tax) to your Card. By providing your Card account information to Facebook,</p>
<p>you authorize us to collect and store it and other related transaction information.</p>
<p>When you purchase gift credits, you are purchasing only a limited license to use certain features on the Facebook</p>
<p>Service that will enhance your experience on the Facebook Service, such as giving virtual gifts to your friends. Gift</p>
<p>credits have no real value, are non-refundable and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value</p>
<p>from Facebook at any time. Facebook does not guarantee the transferability of gift credits. Gift credits may not be</p>
<p>transferred to any third party outside of the Facebook Service and may not be used as a means to transfer money</p>
<p>to a third party. You agree that Facebook has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or</p>
<p>eliminate gift credits as it sees fit, and Facebook will have no liability to you for exercising such rights.</p>

<p>Facebook Service as well as the collection, handling and sharing of personal information that you provide to third</p>
<p>parties. If you have a dispute with a third party relating to the Facebook Service, you release Facebook and its</p>
<p>directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Facebook Entities") from any claims, causes of action</p>
<p>and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with such dispute. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A</p>
<p>general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the</p>
<p>time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
<p>If you believe that the Facebook Service or Facebook's business practices are in any way unfair, fraudulent or</p>
<p>unlawful, you agree to bring it to the attention of Facebook's legal department. If you do not report the issue or</p>

<p>("Platform Developers") to create websites and applications that retrieve data made available by Facebook and its</p>
<p>users and/or that retrieve authorized data from third-party sites for use on the Facebook Site ("Platform</p>
<p>Applications")</p>
<p>Platform Developers may use the Facebook Platform and create Platform Applications only in accordance with the</p>
<p>terms and conditions set forth in an agreement entered into between Facebook and the Platform Developer</p>
<p>("Developer Terms"). Our standard Developer Terms consist of the Facebook Developer Terms of Service and the</p>
<p>related Facebook Platform Application Guidelines. We may from time to time enter into separate agreements with</p>
<p>certain third party Platform Developers that contain different or additional terms, provided however, that each such</p>
<p>separate agreement will require the third party Platform Developer to only display your information in accordance</p>
<p>with your Facebook privacy settings. The standard Developer Terms are subject to change without prior notice at</p>
<p>any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these documents from time to time. ALL USE OF</p>
<p>THE FACEBOOK PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>Users who install Platform Applications must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the Platform Application</p>
<p>Terms of Use ("Application User Terms") and in these Terms of Use. The Application User Terms are subject to</p>
<p>change without prior notice at any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these terms each</p>
<p>time you install an application and from time to time. Platform Developers may require you to agree to their own</p>
<p>terms of service, privacy policies and/or other policies as a condition of using Platform Applications. Platform</p>
<p>Applications have not been approved, endorsed, or reviewed in any manner by Facebook, and we are not</p>
<p>responsible for your use of or inability to use any Platform Applications, including the content, accuracy, or reliability</p>
<p>of such Application and the privacy practices or other policies of Developers. YOU USE SUCH PLATFORM</p>

<p>If you, your friends or members of your network use any Platform Applications, such Platform Applications may</p>
<p>access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings as further</p>
<p>described in our Privacy Policy. Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and use</p>
<p>of such information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse</p>
<p>of such information by such Platform Developers, we do not screen or approve Developers, and we cannot and do</p>
<p>not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such restrictions and agreements. Certain actions you take</p>
<p>through the Platform Applications may be displayed to your friends in your profile, mini-feed and news feed, and you</p>
<p>may opt-out of displaying your Platform Application actions on the Privacy Settings page. Please report any</p>
<p>suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may set your preferences for your news feed and mini-feed here.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Connect ("Connect") enables participating third party websites to work just like Facebook Platform</p>
<p>applications. Once you allow a third party website to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook</p>
<p>login information to log into that website. The third party website will be able to: generate and publish news feed</p>
<p>and other stories about actions you take on their website; access Facebook information related to you (including</p>
<p>your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the third party</p>
<p>site; and allow you to interact with your friends on the website. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to</p>
<p>allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting participating third party websites, and allow</p>
<p>Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on those third party websites. In addition, once</p>
<p>you allow a participating third party website to connect with Facebook, you agree to allow Facebook and such third</p>
<p>party website to generate and publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on the website without</p>
<p>any additional permission. In the event you no longer want the third party website to publish stories about you, you</p>
<p>can always disable this feature by changing your application settings.</p>
<p>When your friends connect their Facebook account with a participating third party website, Facebook Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find Facebook friends that may also be users of that third party website, and invite them to use</p>
<p>Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you, you may change your privacy settings to</p>
<p>disable this feature.</p>
<p>Connect also gives you the ability to permit Facebook and participating third party websites to generate and publish</p>
<p>news feed and other stories about actions you have taken on such websites, even if you have not gone through the</p>
<p>Connect process. In such cases, you will be asked whether you want to publish the story on Facebook, and will be</p>
<p>given the opportunity to save your answer for future stories. In the event you want to change your settings for</p>
<p>that website, visit your application settings.</p>
<p></span>L<span style="background-color: red;">ike Platform Applications</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">I</span><span style="background-color: red;">third party websites that participate in Connect are required, among other things, to</p>
<p>protect your privacy consistent with your Facebook privacy settings and Facebook's privacy policy.</p>
