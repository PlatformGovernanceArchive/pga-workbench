<p>By using or accessing the Facebook Service, you agree that you have read, understand and are bound by these</p>
<p>Terms of Use ("Terms"). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or delete portions of these Terms at</p>
<p>any time without further notice. Your continued use of the Facebook Service after any such changes constitutes</p>
<p>your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p>We care about the privacy of our users and encourage you to read our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>offender in any jurisdiction, you may not use the Facebook Service.</p>
<p><strong>Registration; Account Security</strong></p>
<p>When you register for and use the Facebook Service, you will be asked to provide information about yourself ("User</p>
<p>Data"). Your User Data must be accurate and current at all times. You are solely responsible for maintaining the</p>
<p>security of your account. This means, for example, that you may not share your password or let anyone else access</p>
<p>your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, please let us know immediately.</p>

<p><strong>User Content</strong></p>
<p>By using or accessing the Facebook Service, you represent, warrant and agree that you will not Post:</p>
<p>User Content that violates the law or anyone's rights, including intellectual property ("IP") rights or other</p>
<p>proprietary rights (such as rights of publicity and privacy);</p>
<p>any Contact Information or private information of any third party;</p>
<p>false, misleading or fraudulent information;</p>
<p>any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code designed to interrupt, destroy, or</p>
<p>limit the functionality of any computer or telecommunications equipment;</p>
<p>alcohol-related or other mature content on Pages on the Facebook Service that have not set appropriate</p>
<p>age based restrictions (based on the country in which the page will be viewable); or</p>
<p>User Content that is threatening, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that depicts nudity,</p>
<p>pornography or graphic or gratuitous violence, or anything else that we may consider offensive.</p>
<p>Facebook does not pre-screen, review, edit or approve any User Content. Facebook may, in its sole discretion,</p>
<p>remove or disable access to any User Content.</p>
<p>"User Content" means any photos, text, link, audio, video, designs, ads and anything else that you Post on or</p>
<p>through the Facebook Service. "Post" means to upload, post, transmit, share, store, link to or otherwise make</p>
<p>available on or through the Facebook Service.</p>
<p><strong>IP Complaints</strong></p>
<p>We respect the IP rights of others and we prohibit users from Posting User Content that violates another party's IP</p>
<p>rights. When we receive a proper claim of IP infringement, we promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly</p>
<p>infringing User Content. We also terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. If you</p>
<p>believe that User Content on the Facebook Service infringes your IP rights, please visit our How to Report Claims of</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Infringement page. All IP claims can be made through that page, including any copyright claims,</p>
<p>which will be handled in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you are a user whose User Content</p>
<p>was removed due to alleged copyright infringement, and you believe the removal was mistaken, please visit our How</p>
<p>to Appeal Claims of Copyright Infringement page.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>
<p>There are features of the Facebook Service that may be accessible via certain mobile carriers (the "Mobile</p>
<p>Services"). While we currently do not charge for these Mobile Services, your carrier's normal messaging, data and</p>
<p>other rates and fees will still apply. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we may communicate with you by</p>
<p>SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device, and that certain information about your</p>
<p><strong>Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.</strong></p>
<p>Remember Me</p>
<p>Forgot your password?</p>
<p><strong>Login</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign Up</strong></p>
<p>usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile</p>
<p>telephone number, you agree to promptly update your account information on the Facebook Service to ensure that</p>
<p>your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Applications and Connect Sites</strong></p>
<p>The "Facebook Platform" is a set of APIs and services that third parties may use to (a) create applications for use on</p>
<p>the Facebook Service ("Applications") and (b) enable their websites to work like Applications ("Connect Sites")</p>
<p>through Facebook Connect ("Connect"). Applications and Connect Sites will be referred to together as</p>
<p>"Applications/Connect Sites," which should be read as Applications and/or Connect Sites.</p>
<p>If you authorize an Application or allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you</p>
<p>agree that such Application/Connect Site can (a) access information on the Facebook Service related to you</p>
<p>(including your profile information, friends and privacy settings) and (b) generate and publish news feed and other</p>
<p>stories about actions you take on such Application/Connect Site without any additional permission. If you want to</p>
<p>change the information that Applications/Connect Sites can access, you may modify your privacy settings. If you no</p>
<p>longer want these news feed or other stories to be published, you can disable this feature by changing your</p>
<p>application settings. If you, your friends or members of your network use any Application/Connect Site, such</p>
<p>Applications/Connect Sites may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your</p>
<p>privacy settings.</p>
<p>Once you allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you will be able to use your</p>
<p>login information for the Facebook Service to log into and interact with your friends on that Connect Site. In order to</p>
<p>make Connect possible, you agree to allow us to check your cookies for the Facebook Service when you are visiting</p>
<p>Connect Sites. When your friends connect their account on the Facebook Service with a Connect Site, Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find friends on the Facebook Service that may also be users of that Connect Site and invite them to</p>
<p>use Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you to connect on a Connect Site, you may</p>
<p>change your privacy settings to disable this feature. Even if you have not gone through the Connect process, you</p>
<p>may be able to authorize a Connect Site to generate and publish news feed and other stories about an action or all</p>
<p>actions that you take on that Connect Site. If you want to change your settings for that Connect Site, visit your</p>
<p>application settings.</p>
<p><strong>Your Privacy Practices</strong></p>
<p>We respect the privacy rights of third parties, and you must do so as well on the Facebook Service.</p>
<p>If you collect, access or use information relating to any user of the Facebook Service (including information</p>
<p>contained in any user profile) you must obtain consent from the user and make it clear to the user that the</p>
<p>collection, access and use is being carried out by you and not Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Gift Credits</strong></p>
<p>You must be authorized to use the credit card, debit card or other payment source ("Card") you provide to purchase</p>
<p>gift credits. By purchasing gift credits, you authorize Facebook or its designated payment processor to charge the</p>
<p>purchase amount (plus any applicable tax) to your Card. By providing your Card account information to Facebook,</p>
<p>you authorize us to collect and store it and other related transaction information.</p>
<p>When you purchase gift credits, you are purchasing only a limited license to use certain features on the Facebook</p>
<p>Service that will enhance your experience on the Facebook Service, such as giving virtual gifts to your friends. Gift</p>
<p>credits have no real value, are non-refundable and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value</p>
<p>from Facebook at any time. Facebook does not guarantee the transferability of gift credits. Gift credits may not be</p>
<p>transferred to any third party outside of the Facebook Service and may not be used as a means to transfer money</p>
<p>to a third party. You agree that Facebook has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or</p>
<p>eliminate gift credits as it sees fit, and Facebook will have no liability to you for exercising such rights.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership; Proprietary Rights</strong></p>
<p>Except for User Content and Applications/Connect Sites, all materials, content and trademarks on the Facebook</p>
<p>Service are the property of Facebook and/or its licensors and are protected by all relevant IP laws and other</p>
<p>proprietary rights (including copyright, trademark, trade dress and patent laws) and any other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, FACEBOOK, the F LOGO, FB, FACE, POKE, THE WALL and 32665 and all related</p>
<p>logos, are trademarks of Facebook. Except as expressly authorized by Facebook in writing, you agree not to use,</p>
<p>sell, license, distribute, copy, publish, stream, publicly perform or display, transmit, reformat, modify, edit, frame,</p>
<p>translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works or otherwise make unauthorized use of the materials, content or</p>
<p>trademarks.</p>
<p><strong>Licenses</strong></p>
<p>You are solely responsible for the User Content that you Post on or through the Facebook Service. You hereby</p>
<p>grant Facebook an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right</p>
<p>to sublicense) to (a) use, copy, publish, stream, store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat,</p>
<p>modify, edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works and distribute (through multiple tiers), any</p>
<p>User Content you (i) Post on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to</p>
<p>your privacy settings or (ii) enable a user to Post, including by offering a Share Link on your website and (b) to use</p>
<p>your name, likeness and image for any purpose, including commercial or advertising, each of (a) and (b) on or in</p>
<p>connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof. You represent and warrant that you have all rights</p>
<p>and permissions to grant the foregoing licenses.</p>
<p>If you own or control a website, you may place Facebook's share link button, logo and/or text (a "Share Link"),</p>
<p>including all trademarks therein, on your website for the sole purpose of enabling users to Post links or content from</p>
<p>your website on the Facebook Service. By offering a Share Link on your website, you agree, represent and warrant</p>
<p>that you will not place a Share Link on any page containing content that would violate these Terms if Posted on the</p>
<p>Facebook Service. The rights granted in this paragraph may be revoked by us at any time in our sole discretion, and</p>
<p>upon such termination, you will immediately remove all Share Links from your website.</p>
<p><strong>Submissions</strong></p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information that</p>
<p>you provide to Facebook ("Submissions"), are non-confidential and non-proprietary. Facebook will be entitled to the</p>
<p>unrestricted use of any such Submission for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or</p>
<p>compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong>User Disputes; Complaints</strong></p>
<p>You agree not to hold Facebook responsible or liable for the User Content or actions of third parties (including your</p>
<p>interactions with users) on or relating to the Facebook Service. This includes transactions conducted on the</p>
<p>Facebook Service as well as the collection, handling and sharing of personal information that you provide to third</p>
<p>parties. If you have a dispute with a third party relating to the Facebook Service, you release Facebook and its</p>
<p>directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Facebook Entities") from any claims, causes of action</p>
<p>and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way</p>
<p>connected with such dispute. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A</p>
<p>general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the</p>
<p>time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
<p>If you believe that the Facebook Service or Facebook's business practices are in any way unfair, fraudulent or</p>
<p>unlawful, you agree to bring it to the attention of Facebook's legal department. If you do not report the issue or</p>
<p>continue using the service after discovering the issue, you expressly waive the right to claim that the Facebook</p>
<p>Service is unfair, fraudulent or unlawful with respect to that issue.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Facebook Entities harmless from and against any claim or cause of action brought</p>
<p>by a third party as well as any related damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) ("Claim")</p>
<p>arising out of or related to your (a) use of the Facebook Service or any of the applications, features, content or</p>
<p>materials related thereto; (b) violation of these Terms; (c) violation of the rights of any other person or entity; or (d)</p>
<p>breach of the representations, warranties and covenants made by you herein. Facebook reserves the right, at your</p>
<p>expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify</p>
<p>Facebook, and you agree to cooperate with Facebook's defense of these Claims.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>Except as set forth in the paragraph below, you agree that all claims and disputes between you and Facebook that</p>
<p>arise out of or relate in any way to the Terms or your use of the Facebook Service will be resolved either by (a)</p>
<p>binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in Santa Clara County, California or (b) binding non-appearance based</p>
<p>arbitration conducted by telephone, online or based solely on written submission. Such arbitration will be</p>
<p>administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") (see www.jamsadr.com) pursuant to its</p>
<p>Comprehensive Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator's award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any</p>
<p>court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>With respect to any claims or disputes you intend to bring on behalf of a class, you agree to arbitrate whether a</p>
<p>class could be certified before bringing such action in a court of law. If the arbitrator refuses to certify the class, you</p>
<p>will continue to resolve your individual claims or disputes through binding arbitration. If the arbitrator finds that a</p>
<p>class should be certified, you may file the class action in a court of law provided you waive any right to a trial by</p>
<p>jury. Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief may also be brought in a court of law.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law; Venue and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>or your use of the Facebook Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California (and United States</p>
<p>federal laws applicable therein), without regard to principles of conflict of laws. You further agree that you will bring</p>
<p>any claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration (as set forth above) in, and you submit to the exclusive</p>
<p>jurisdiction of, the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California.</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>The "Facebook Service" means the features, services and properties that Facebook makes available through (a)</p>
<p>www.facebook.com or any other Facebook-branded or co-branded website (including, without limitation, any and all</p>
<p>sub-domains and all international, mobile versions and successors thereof), (b) the Facebook Platform and (c) other</p>
<p>media, devices or networks now existing or later developed. Unless otherwise specified, the terms "includes,"</p>
<p>"including," "e.g.," "for example," and other similar terms used herein are deemed to include the term "without</p>
<p>limitation" immediately thereafter. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not</p>
<p>constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If, for any reason, any provision of</p>
<p>these Terms or portion thereof is rendered invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms will remain in full</p>
<p>force and effect and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties. An</p>
<p>arbitrator or court will substitute or rewrite any invalid or unenforceable term or provision to make such term or</p>
<p>provision valid and enforceable. All communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to these Terms will be</p>
<p>in the English language. You consent to receiving communications and notices from Facebook at the email address</p>
<p>you provide in registering for the Facebook Service or otherwise elect in your account settings. These Terms</p>
<p>constitute the entire agreement and supersede any prior agreement between you and us regarding your use of the</p>
<p>Facebook Service.</p>
