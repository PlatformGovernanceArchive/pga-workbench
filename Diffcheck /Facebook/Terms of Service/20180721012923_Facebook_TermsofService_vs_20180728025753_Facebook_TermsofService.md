1. Our services

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer

together. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described

below to you:

**Provide a personalised experience for you:**

**Provide a personalised experience for you:**

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,

stories, events, ads and other content that you see in News Feed or our

video platform to the Pages that you follow and other features that you

might use, such as Trending, Marketplace and search. We use the data

we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices and

settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products –

to personalise your experience.

**Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:**

**Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:**

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organisations and others that matter to you across the Facebook

Products you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for

you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to

follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people who you may

want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities,

and we believe that our services are most useful when people are

connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

**matters to you:**

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to

communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you

– for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across

the Facebook Products that you use, sending messages to a friend or

several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your

profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for

People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We

employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced

technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct

towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or

protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we

will take appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing

content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account or

contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook

Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone

using one of our Products.

**functional services for everyone:**

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence,

machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use

our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location.

For example, technology like this helps people who have visual

impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on

Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and

communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet

in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to

improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity

that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

**Research ways to make our services better:**

**Facebook Company Products:**

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organisations and others that are important to you. We design our

systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the

different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use

data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for

you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you

to communicate with a business that you follow on Facebook through

Messenger.

To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content

Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered

transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to

host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,

translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent

with your privacy and application settings). This means, for

example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us

permission to store, copy and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that

support our service or other Facebook Products that you use.

You can end this licence at any time by deleting your content or

account. You should know that, for technical reasons, any content

that you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup

copies (though it will not be visible to other users). </span>In <span style="background-color: green;">addition,

content that you delete may continue to appear if you have shared

That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and

other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.

That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.

That infringes or violates someone else's rights.

2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that

could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or

appearance of our Products.

3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using

automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to

access data you do not have permission to access.

We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if

applicable, we may take action against your account, for the reasons

described below. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly

infringe other people's intellectual property rights.

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or

conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property

rights) or our terms and policies.

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: You own the

content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook

Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights

you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with

anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we

need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in

connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,

transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to

host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,

translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with

your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that

if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store,

copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings)

such as service providers that support our service or other

Facebook Products you use.

You can end this license any time by deleting your content or

account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you

delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies

(though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you

delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and

they have not deleted it.

2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about

your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us

permission to use your name and profile picture and information

about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection

with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across

our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we

may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event

or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display

its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who

have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.

You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.

If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a parent

or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your behalf. (This

language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal settlement.)

3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you download

or use our software, you give us permission to download and install

upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance,

and further develop it.

**4. Limits on using our intellectual property**

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and

make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or

sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on

Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only

use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly

permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written

permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under

an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile,

or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

**4. Additional provisions**

**1. Updating our Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to

make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may

need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our

services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you

before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to

review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in

effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree

to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook

community, you can delete your account at any time.</span>

**2. Account suspension or termination**

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to

express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine that you have <span style="background-color: green;">clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached

our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards,

we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may

also suspend or disable your account if required to do so by law. Where
