<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our</p>
<p>terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing</p>
<p>Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will</p>
<p>find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can</p>
<p>use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to</p>
<p>read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your</p>
<p>privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically</li>
</ol>
<p>give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in</p>
<p>connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account</p>
<p>unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time</p>
<p>(but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and</li>
</ol>
<p>information as well as content and information that others have shared with you. We require applications to</p>
<p>respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,</p>
<p>and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what</p>
<p>information other people may share with applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,</li>
</ol>
<p>including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your</p>
<p>name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may</li>
</ol>
<p>use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which</p>
<p>includes the following commitments by you:</p>
<ol>

</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission.</p>

</ol>
<p>content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>

</li>

<p>functionality.</p>
<ol>
<li>

<p>WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
