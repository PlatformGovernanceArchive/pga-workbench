<p><strong>1. Our Services</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer</p>
<p>together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described</p>
<p>below to you:</p>
<p><strong>Provide a personalized experience for you:</strong></p>
<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as</p>
<p>Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize</p>
<p>your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Connect you with people and organizations you care about:</strong></p>
<p>We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you</p>
<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>
<p>people, groups, and organizations they care about.</p>
<p><strong>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what</strong></p>
<p><strong>matters to you:</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to</p>
<p>communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you -</p>
<p>for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across</p>
<p>the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several</p>
<p>people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We</p>
<p>also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use</p>
<p>technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share</p>
<p>more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Facebook! </p>
<p>These Terms govern your use of Facebook and the products,</p>
<p>features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the</p>
<p>Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state</p>
<p>that separate terms (and not these) apply.</p>
<p>Join or Log Into Facebook   </p>
<p><strong>Sign Up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest</strong></p>
<p><strong>you:</strong></p>
<p>We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you</p>
<p>discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many</p>
<p>businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook</p>
<p>Products. Our partners pay us to show their content to you, and we design</p>
<p>our services so that the sponsored content you see is as relevant and</p>
<p>useful to you as everything else you see on our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:</strong></p>
<p>People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ</p>
<p>dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical</p>
<p>systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others,</p>
<p>and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our</p>
<p>community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take</p>
<p>appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, blocking</p>
<p>access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law</p>
<p>enforcement. We share data with other Facebook Companies when we</p>
<p>detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and</strong></p>
<p><strong>functional services for everyone:</strong></p>
<p>We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that</p>
<p>people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or</p>
<p>geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who</p>
<p>have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos</p>
<p>shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network</p>
<p>and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet</p>
<p>in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to</p>
<p>improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity</p>
<p>that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.</p>
<p><strong>Research ways to make our services better:</strong></p>
<p>We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our</p>
<p>Products. One way we do this is by analyzing the data we have and</p>
<p>understanding how people use our Products. You can learn more about</p>
<p>some of our research efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Company Products:</strong></p>
<p>Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>
<p>organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our</p>
<p>systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the</p>
<p>different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use</p>
<p>data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for</p>
<p>you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you</p>
<p>to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through</p>
<p>Messenger.</p>
<p><strong>Enable global access to our services:</strong></p>
<p>To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and</p>
<p>data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside</p>
<p>your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or</p>
<p>controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.</p>
<p>Return to top</p>
<p><strong>2. Our Data Policy and Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choices</strong></p>
<p>To provide these services, we must collect and use your personal data. We detail our</p>
<p>practices in the Data Policy, which you must agree to in order to use our Products. </p>
<p>We also encourage you to review the privacy choices you have in your settings.</p>
<p>Return to top</p>
<p><strong>3. Your Commitments to Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>and Our Community</strong></p>
<p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we</p>
<p>need you to make the following commitments:</p>
<p><strong>1. Who can use Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is</p>
<p>safer and more accountable. For that reason, you must:</p>
<p>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</p>
<p>Provide accurate information about yourself.</p>
<p>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal</p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to</p>
<p>others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).</p>
<p>We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot</p>
<p>use Facebook if:</p>
<p>You are under 13 years old.</p>
<p>You are a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>We previously disabled your account for violations of our terms or</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software</p>
<p>under applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>2. What you can share and do on Facebook</strong></p>
<p>We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share</p>
<p>content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and</p>
<p>well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree</p>
<p>not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support</p>
<p>others in doing so):</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</li>
</ol>
<p>That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and other</p>
<p>terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.</p>
<p>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</p>
<p>That infringes or violates someone else's rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that</li>
</ol>
<p>could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or</p>
<p>appearance of our Products.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You may not access or collect data from our Products using</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not access or collect data from our Products using</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to</p>
<p>access data you do not have permission to access.</p>
<p>We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if</p>
<p>applicable, we may take action against your account, for the reasons</p>
<p>described below. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly</p>
<p>infringe other people's intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or</p>
<p>conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property</p>
<p>rights) or our terms and policies.</p>
<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use content you create and share: You own the</li>
</ol>
<p>content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights</p>
<p>you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with</p>
<p>anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we</p>
<p>need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content. </p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered</p>
<p>by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in</p>
<p>connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to</p>
<p>host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,</p>
<p>translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with</p>
<p>your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that</p>
<p>if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store,</p>
<p>copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings)</p>
<p>such as service providers that support our service or other</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use. </p>
<p>You can end this license any time by deleting your content or</p>
<p>account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you</p>
<p>delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies</p>
<p>(though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you</p>
<p>delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and</p>
<p>they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about</li>
</ol>
<p>your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us</p>
<p>permission to use your name and profile picture and information</p>
<p>about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection</p>
<p>with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across</p>
<p>our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we</p>
<p>may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event</p>
<p>or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display</p>
<p>its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who</p>
<p>have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.</p>
<p>You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences. </p>
<p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a parent</p>
<p>or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your behalf. (This</p>
<p>language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal settlement.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to update software you use or download: If you download</li>
</ol>
<p>or use our software, you give us permission to download and install</p>
<p>upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance,</p>
<p>and further develop it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Limits on using our intellectual property</strong></p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and</p>
<p>make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or</p>
<p>sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on</p>
<p>Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only</p>
<p>use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly</p>
<p>permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written</p>
<p>permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under</p>
<p>an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile,</p>
<p>or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.</p>
<p>Return to top</p>
<p><strong>4. Additional provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to</p>
<p>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may</p>
<p>need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our</p>
<p>services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you</p>
<p>before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to</p>
<p>review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in</p>
<p>effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products. </p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree</p>
<p>to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook</p>
<p>community, you can delete your account at any time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Account suspension or termination</strong></p>
<p>We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to</p>
<p>express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas. </p>
<p>If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take</p>
<p>action against your account to protect our community and services,</p>
<p>including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may</p>
<p>also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure</p>
<p>for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where</p>
<p>appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to</p>
<p>access it. You can learn more about what you can do if your account has</p>
<p>been disabled. </p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an</p>
<p>agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in</p>
<p>place: 3, 4.2-4.5</p>
<p><strong>3. Limits on liability</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear</p>
<p>guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are</p>
<p>provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,</p>
<p>secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or</p>
<p>imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL</p>
<p>WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE</p>
<p>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A</p>
<p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not</p>
<p>control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not</p>
<p>control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not</p>
<p>responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any</p>
<p>content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful,</p>
<p>and other objectionable content). </p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly,</p>
<p>our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,</p>
<p>and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits,</p>
<p>revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect,</p>
<p>exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to</p>
<p>these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of</p>
<p>the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or</p>
<p>relating to these Terms or the Facebook Products will not exceed the</p>
<p>greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
<p><strong>4. Disputes</strong></p>
<p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid</p>
<p>disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful</p>
<p>to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply. </p>
<p>For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises</p>
<p>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you</p>
<p>agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the</p>
<p>Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo</p>
<p>County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of</p>
<p>these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws</p>
<p>of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without</p>
<p>regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p><strong>5. Other</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and</li>
</ol>
<p>Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and</p>
<p>Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede</p>
<p>any prior agreements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental</li>
</ol>
<p>terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be</p>
<p>made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For</p>
<p>instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or</p>
<p>business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing</p>
<p>apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our</p>
<p>measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If</p>
<p>you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our</p>
<p>Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with</p>
<p>these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the</p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<ol>
<li>If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the</li>
</ol>
<p>remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to</p>
<p>enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any</p>
<p>amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and</p>
<p>signed by us.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these</li>
</ol>
<p>Terms to anyone else without our consent.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage</li>
</ol>
<p>your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a</p>
<p>person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document</p>
<p>expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or</p>
<p>incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is</p>
<p>memorialized.</p>
<p>memorialized.</p>
<ol>
<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of</li>
</ol>
<p>our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable</p>
<p>by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or</p>
<p>by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your</li>
</ol>
<p>account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else</p>
<p>claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use</p>
<p>in everyday life).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about</li>
</ol>
<p>our products and services. But you should know that we may use</p>
<p>them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we</p>
<p>are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
</ol>
