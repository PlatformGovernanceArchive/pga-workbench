**User Content**

By using or accessing the Facebook Service, you represent, warrant and agree that you will not Post:

User Content that violates the law or anyone's rights, including intellectual property ("IP") rights or other

proprietary rights (such as rights of publicity and privacy);

any Contact Information or private information of any third party;

false, misleading or fraudulent information;

any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code designed to interrupt, destroy, or

limit the functionality of any computer or telecommunications equipment;

alcohol-related or other mature content on Pages on the Facebook Service that have not set appropriate

age based restrictions (based on the country in which the page will be viewable); or

User Content that is threatening, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that depicts nudity,

pornography or graphic or gratuitous violence, or anything else that we may consider offensive.

Facebook does not pre-screen, review, edit or approve any User Content. Facebook may, in its sole discretion,

remove or disable access to any User Content.

"User Content" means any photos, text, link, audio, video, designs, ads and anything else that you Post on or

through the Facebook Service. "Post" means to upload, post, transmit, share, store, link to or otherwise make

available on or through the Facebook Service.

**IP Complaints**

We respect the IP rights of others and we prohibit users from Posting User Content that violates another party's IP

rights. When we receive a proper claim of IP infringement, we promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly

infringing User Content. We also terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. If you

believe that User Content on the Facebook Service infringes your IP rights, please visit our How to Report Claims of

Intellectual Property Infringement page. All IP claims can be made through that page, including any copyright claims,

which will be handled in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you are a user whose User Content

was removed due to alleged copyright infringement, and you believe the removal was mistaken, please visit our How

to Appeal Claims of Copyright Infringement page.

**Mobile**

There are features of the Facebook Service that may be accessible via certain mobile carriers (the "Mobile

Services"). While we currently do not charge for these Mobile Services, your carrier's normal messaging, data and

other rates and fees will still apply. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we may communicate with you by

SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device, and that certain information about your

<span style="background-color: red;">The "Facebook Platform" is a set of APIs and services that third parties may use to (a) create applications for use on

the Facebook Service ("Applications") and (b) enable their websites to work like Applications ("Connect Sites")

through Facebook Connect ("Connect"). Applications and Connect Sites will be referred to together as

"Applications/Connect Sites," which should be read as Applications and/or Connect Sites.

If you authorize an Application or allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you

agree that such Application/Connect Site can (a) access information on the Facebook Service related to you

(including your profile information, friends and privacy settings) and (b) generate and publish news feed and other

stories about actions you take on such Application/Connect Site without any additional permission. If you want to

change the information that Applications/Connect Sites can access, you may modify your privacy settings. If you no

longer want these news feed or other stories to be published, you can disable this feature by changing your

application settings. If you, your friends or members of your network use any Application/Connect Site, such

Applications/Connect Sites may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your

privacy settings.

Once you allow a Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you will be able to use your

login information for the Facebook Service to log into and interact with your friends on that Connect Site. In order to

make Connect possible, you agree to allow us to check your cookies for the Facebook Service when you are visiting

Connect Sites. When your friends connect their account on the Facebook Service with a Connect Site, Connect will

enable them to find friends on the Facebook Service that may also be users of that Connect Site and invite them to

use Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you to connect on a Connect Site, you may

change your privacy settings to disable this feature. Even if you have not gone through the Connect process, you

may be able to authorize a Connect Site to generate and publish news feed and other stories about an action or all

actions that you take on that Connect Site. If you want to change your settings for that Connect Site, visit your

application settings.

**Your Privacy Practices**

We respect the privacy rights of third parties, and you must do so as well on the Facebook Service.

If you collect, access or use information relating to any user of the Facebook Service (including information

contained in any user profile) you must obtain consent from the user and make it clear to the user that the

collection, access and use is being carried out by you and not Facebook.

**Gift Credits**

You must be authorized to use the credit card, debit card or other payment source ("Card") you provide to purchase

gift credits. By purchasing gift credits, you authorize Facebook or its designated payment processor to charge the

purchase amount (plus any applicable tax) to your Card. By providing your Card account information to Facebook,

you authorize us to collect and store it and other related transaction information.

When you purchase gift credits, you are purchasing only a limited license to use certain features on the Facebook

Service that will enhance your experience on the Facebook Service, such as giving virtual gifts to your friends. Gift

credits have no real value, are non-refundable and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value

from Facebook at any time. Facebook does not guarantee the transferability of gift credits. Gift credits may not be

transferred to any third party outside of the Facebook Service and may not be used as a means to transfer money

to a third party. You agree that Facebook has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or

eliminate gift credits as it sees fit, and Facebook will have no liability to you for exercising such rights.

directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Facebook Entities") from any claims, causes of action

and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way

connected with such dispute. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A

general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the

time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

If you believe that the Facebook Service or Facebook's business practices are in any way unfair, fraudulent or

unlawful, you agree to bring it to the attention of Facebook's legal department. If you do not report the issue or

continue using the service after discovering the issue, you expressly waive the right to claim that the Facebook

Service is unfair, fraudulent or unlawful with respect to that issue.

**Indemnity**

You agree to indemnify and hold Facebook Entities harmless from and against any claim or cause of action brought

by a third party as well as any related damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) ("Claim")

arising out of or related to your (a) use of the Facebook Service or any of the applications, features, content or

materials related thereto; (b) violation of these Terms; (c) violation of the rights of any other person or entity; or (d)

breach of the representations, warranties and covenants made by you herein. Facebook reserves the right, at your

expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify

Facebook, and you agree to cooperate with Facebook's defense of these Claims.

**Facebook</span> <span style="background-color: green;">Platform Applications**

The Facebook Platform is a set of APIs and services provided by Facebook that enable third-party developers

("Platform Developers") to create websites and applications that retrieve data made available by Facebook and its

users and/or that retrieve authorized data from third-party sites for use on the Facebook Site ("Platform

Applications")

Platform Developers may use the Facebook Platform and create Platform Applications only in accordance with the

terms and conditions set forth in an agreement entered into between Facebook and the Platform Developer

("Developer Terms"). Our standard Developer Terms consist of the Facebook Developer Terms of Service and the

related Facebook Platform Application Guidelines. We may from time to time enter into separate agreements with

certain third party Platform Developers that contain different or additional terms, provided however, that each such

separate agreement will require the third party Platform Developer to only display your information in accordance

with your Facebook privacy settings. The standard Developer Terms are subject to change without prior notice at

any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these documents from time to time. ALL USE OF

Users who install Platform Applications must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the Platform Application

Terms of Use ("Application User Terms") and in these Terms of Use. The Application User Terms are subject to

change without prior notice at any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these terms each

time you install an application and from time to time. Platform Developers may require you to agree to their own

terms of service, privacy policies and/or other policies as a condition of using Platform Applications. Platform

Applications have not been approved, endorsed, or reviewed in any manner by Facebook, and we are not

responsible for your use of or inability to use any Platform Applications, including the content, accuracy, or reliability

of such Application and the privacy practices or other policies of Developers. YOU USE SUCH P</span>L<span style="background-color: red;">L</span><span style="background-color: green;">ATFORM</span>

If you</span>,<span style="background-color: green;"> your friends or members of your network use any Platform Applications, such Platform Applications may

access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings as further

described in our Privacy Policy. Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and use

of such information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse

of such information by such Platform Developers, we do not screen or approve Developers, and we cannot and do

not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such restrictions and agreements. Certain actions you take

through the Platform Applications may be displayed to your friends in your profile, mini-feed and news feed, and you

may opt-out of displaying your Platform Application actions on the Privacy Settings page. Please report any

suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform as described in our Privacy Policy.

You may set your preferences for your news feed and mini-feed here.

**Facebook Connect**

Facebook Connect ("Connect") enables participating third party websites to work just like Facebook Platform

applications. Once you allow a third party website to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook

login information to log into that website. The third party website will be able to: generate and publish news feed

and other stories about actions you take on their website; access Facebook information related to you (including

your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the third party

site; and allow you to interact with your friends on the website. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to

allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting participating third party websites, and allow

Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on those third party websites. In addition, once

you allow a participating third party website to connect with Facebook, you agree to allow Facebook and such third

party website to generate and publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on the website without

any additional permission. In the event you no longer want the third party website to publish stories about you, you

can always disable this feature by changing your application settings.

When your friends connect their Facebook account with a participating third party website, Facebook Connect will

enable them to find Facebook friends that may also be users of that third party website, and invite them to use

Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you, you may change your privacy settings to

disable this feature.

Connect also gives you the ability to permit Facebook and participating third party websites to generate and publish

news feed and other stories about actions you have taken on such websites, even if you have not gone through the

Connect process. In such cases, you will be asked whether you want to publish the story on Facebook, and will be

given the opportunity to save your answer for future stories. In the event you want to change your settings for

that website, visit your application settings.

Like Platform Applications, third party websites that participate in Connect are required, among other things, to

protect your privacy consistent with your Facebook privacy settings and Facebook's privacy policy.

**Facebook Pages**

Facebook Pages are special profiles used solely for commercial, political, or charitable purposes. You may not set up

a Facebook Page on behalf of another individual or entity unless you are authorized to do so. This includes fan

Facebook Pages, as well as Facebook Pages to support or criticize another individual or entity.

Rules and shall be subject to the limitations provided for in the AAA Consumer Rules (for consumer disputes). If such

costs are determined to be excessive in a consumer dispute, the Company will be responsible for paying all

arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed reasonable. The arbitrator's award shall be

binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
