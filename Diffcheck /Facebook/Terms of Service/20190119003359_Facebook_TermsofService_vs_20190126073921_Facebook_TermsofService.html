<p><strong>Provide a personalized experience for you:</strong></p>
<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such</p>
<p>as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to</p>
<p>personalize your experience.</p>

<p>We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,</p>

<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>
<p>people, groups, and organizations they care about.</p>

<p>the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several</p>
<p>people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We</p>

<p>technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share</p>
<p>more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.</p>

<p>technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct</p>
<p>towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or</p>
<p>protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we</p>
<p>will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing</p>
<p>content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or</p>
<p>contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook</p>

<p>We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial</p>

<p>people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or</p>
<p>geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who</p>
<p>have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos</p>
<p>shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network</p>
<p>and communication technology to help more people connect to the</p>
<p>internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems</p>

<p><strong>3. Your Commitments to</span> Facebook</strong><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p><strong>and Our Community</strong></p>
<p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we</p>
<p>need you to make the following commitments:</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Who can use Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is</p>
<p>safer and more accountable. For that reason, you must:</p>
<p>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</p>
<p>Provide accurate information about yourself.</p>
<p>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for</p>
<p>personal purposes.</p>
<p>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account</p>
<p>to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our</p>
<p>permission).</p>
<p>We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot</p>
<p>use Facebook if:</p>
<p>You are under 13 years old.</p>
<p>You are a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>We previously disabled your account for violations of our terms<span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p>or</span> <span style="background-color: green;">or</p>
<p></span>policies.</p>
<p>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or</p>
<p>software under applicable laws.</p>
<p><strong>2. What you can share and do on Facebook</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share</p>
<p>content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and</p>
<p>well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree</p>
<p>not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support</p>
<p>others in doing so):</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</li>
</ol>
<p>That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and</p>
<p>other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.</p>
<p>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</p>
<p>That infringes or violates someone else's rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that</li>
</ol>
<p>could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or</p>
<p>appearance of our Products.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to</p>
<p>access data you do not have permission to access.</p>
<p>We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if</p>
<p>applicable, we may take action against your account, for the reasons</p>
<p>described below. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly</p>
<p>infringe other people's intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or</p>
<p>conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property</p>
<p>rights) or our terms and policies.</p>
<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use content you create and share: You own the</li>
</ol>
<p>content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights</p>
<p>you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with</p>
<p>anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we</p>
<p>need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered</p>
<p>by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in</p>
<p>connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to</p>
<p>host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,</p>
<p>translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with</p>
<p>your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that</p>
<p>if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store,</p>
<p>copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings)</p>
<p>such as service providers that support our service or other</p>
<p>Facebook Products you use.</p>
<p>You can end this license any time by deleting your content or</p>
<p>account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you</p>
<p>delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies</p>
<p>(though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you</p>
<p>delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and</p>
<p>they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about</li>
</ol>
<p>your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us</p>
<p>permission to use your name and profile picture and information</p>
<p>about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection</p>
<p>with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across</p>
<p>our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we</p>
<p>may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event</p>
<p>or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display</p>
<p>its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who</p>
<p>have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.</p>
<p>You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a parent</p>
<p>or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your behalf. (This</p>
<p>language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal settlement.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to update software you use or download: If you download</li>
</ol>
<p>or use our software, you give us permission to download and install</p>
<p>upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance,</p>
<p>and further develop it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Limits on using our intellectual property</strong></p>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and</p>
<p>make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or</p>
<p>sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on</p>
<p>Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only</p>
<p>use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly</p>
<p>permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written</p>
<p>permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under</p>
<p>an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile,</p>
<p>or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.</p>
<p>Return to top</p>
<p><strong>4. Additional provisions</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to</p>
<p>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may</p>
<p>need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our</p>
<p>services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you</p>
<p>before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to</p>
<p>review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in</p>
<p>effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree</p>
<p>to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook</p>
<p>community, you can delete your account at any time.</p>

<p>infringe other people's intellectual property rights.</p>

<p><strong>3. The permissions you give us</strong></p>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use content you create and share: You own the</li>
</ol>
<p>content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook</p>
<p>Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights</p>
<p>you have to your own content. You are free to share your content</p>
<p>with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services,</p>
<p>though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered</p>
<p>by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in</p>
<p>connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to</p>
<p>host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,</p>
<p>translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent</p>
<p>with your privacy and application settings). This means, for</p>
<p>example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us</p>
<p>permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again,</p>
<p>consistent with your settings) such as service providers that</p>
<p>support our service or other Facebook Products you use.</p>
<p>You can end this license any time by deleting your content or</p>
<p>account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you</p>
<p>delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies</p>
<p>(though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content</p>
<p>you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others</p>
<p>and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information</li>
</ol>
<p>about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us</p>
<p>permission to use your name and profile picture and information</p>
<p>about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection</p>
<p>with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display</p>
<p>across our Products, without any compensation to you. For</p>
<p>example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an</p>
<p>advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has</p>
<p>paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen</p>
<p>only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've</p>
<p>taken on Facebook. You can learn more about your ad settings and</p>
<p>preferences.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a</p>
<p>parent or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your behalf.</p>
<p>(This language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal</p>
<p>(This language is included pursuant to a court-approved legal</p>

<li>Permission to update software you use or download: If you</li>

<p><strong>1. Updating our Terms</strong></p>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to</p>
<p>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we</p>
<p>may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect</p>
<p>our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will</p>
<p>notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an</p>
<p>opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated</p>
<p>Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our</p>
<p>Products.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not</p>

<p>If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take</p>
<p>action against your account to protect our community and services,</p>
<p>including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may</p>
<p>also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure</p>
<p>for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where</p>
<p>appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try</p>
<p>to access it. You can learn more about what you can do if your account</p>
<p>has been disabled.</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as</p>
