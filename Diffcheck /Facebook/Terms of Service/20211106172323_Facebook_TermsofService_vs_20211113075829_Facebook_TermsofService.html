<p>described below to you:</span></p>
<p><strong>Provide a personalized experience for you:</strong></p>
<p>Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,</p>
<p>stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video</p>
<p>platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such<span style="background-color: red;"> as</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">as </span>Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for</p>
<p>example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you</p>
<p>select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p>and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow</p>
<p>or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to</p>
<p>become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we</p>
<p>believe our services are most useful when people are connected to</p>
<p>people, groups, and organizations they care about.</p>

<p></span>-<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across</p>
<p>the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several</p>
<p>people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We</p>
<p>have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use</p>
<p>technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share</p>

<p>different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use</p>

<p>Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by</p>
<p>using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show</p>
<p>you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the</p>
<p>Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information</p>
<p>about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p>Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This</p>
<p>means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers<span style="background-color: red;"> who</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">who </span>you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>

<p></span>their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>example,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;"></p>
<p></span>people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad<span style="background-color: red;"> to people</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: green;">to people </span>who might be interested.</p>
<p>We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to<span style="background-color: red;"> help</span></p>

<p>Provide accurate information about yourself.</p>
<p>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for</p>
<p>personal purposes.</p>
<p>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account</p>

<p>We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share</p>
<p>content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety</p>
<p>and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore</p>

<p>We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these</p>
<p>provisions.</p>
<p>If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community</p>
<p>Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request</p>
<p>another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or</p>
<p>if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community</p>
<p>of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of</p>
<p>our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to</p>
<p>technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal</p>

<p>conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual</p>
<p>property rights) or our terms and policies.</p>

<p>However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal</p>

<p>run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create</p>
<p>derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and</p>

<p>photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and</p>
<p>share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as</p>
<p>service providers that support our service or other Facebook</p>

<p>within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);</p>
<p>your content has been used by others in accordance with</p>
<p>this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this</p>
<p>license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
<p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of</p>
<p>our terms and policies (for example, to identify or</p>
<p>investigate misuse of our Products or systems);</p>
<p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the</p>

<p>expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or</p>
<p>incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is</p>
<p>memorialized.</p>
<ol>
<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of</li>
</ol>
<p>our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable</p>
<p>by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or</p>
<p>by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your</li>

<p>account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else</p>

<p>in everyday life).</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>our products and services. But you should know that we may use</p>
