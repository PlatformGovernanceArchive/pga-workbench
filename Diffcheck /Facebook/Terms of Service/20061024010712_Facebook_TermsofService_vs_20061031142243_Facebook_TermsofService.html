<p>use of the Share Service. A Third Party Site that posts a Share Link on its web site is referred to herein as an "Online</p>
<p>Content Provider" and shall abide and be subject to the applicable sections of these Terms of Use. A "Share Link" is a</p>
<p>button and/or a text link appearing on an Online Content Provider's web page that, upon being clicked by a User, enables</p>

<p>and content from that page. </p>
<p>In the event that the Share Link is a button that contains any icons or other graphic images, trademarks or other</p>
<p>proprietary materials of Company, Online Content Provider is granted permission to use such images, trademarks or other</p>
<p>materials solely for the purpose of placing the Share Link on Online Content Provider's site and solely in the current form</p>
<p>provided by the Company. In the event that the Share Link is a text link, it must include the word "Facebook" as part of</p>
<p>the link. The rights granted in this paragraph may be revoked by Company at any time with or without cause in its sole</p>
<p>discretion, and upon such termination, Online Content Provider agree to immediately remove all Share Links from its site. </p>
<p>In order for an Online Content Provider to include a Share Link on its pages, the Third Party Site must not contain any</p>
<p>web content that if shared or posted by a User would be a violation of the User conduct rules set forth above. Without</p>
<p>limiting the forgoing, Online Content Provider agrees not to post a Share Link on any web site that contains, and</p>
<p>represents and warrants that such web site does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing, harmful,</p>
<p>threatening, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent, or invasive of</p>
<p>privacy or publicity rights or that may expose Company or its Users to any harm or liability of any type. Upon including of</p>
<p>a Share Link, Online Content Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and</p>
<p>each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss,</p>
<p>liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in</p>
<p>connection with such Share Link, any links, content or other items or materials which may be shared or posted through</p>
<p>such Share Link, or any breach or alleged breach of the foregoing representations and warranties. </p>
<p>By including a Share Link, Online Content Provider automatically grants, and represents and warrants that it has the right</p>
<p>to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the</p>
<p>right to sublicense) to use the Share Service in order to link to, use, copy, publish, stream, publicly perform, publicly</p>
