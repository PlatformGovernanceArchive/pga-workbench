**Provide a personalized experience for you:**

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,

stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video

platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such

as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have - for

example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you

select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to

personalize your experience.

**Connect you with people and organizations you care about:**

**Connect you with people and organizations you care about:**

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,

organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook

Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you

and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow

or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to

become friends with.</span> S<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">t</span>r<span style="background-color: green;">onger ties make for better communities, and we

- for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across

the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several

people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We

also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use

technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share

more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.

People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We

employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced

technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct

towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or

protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we

will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing

content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or

contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook

Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone

using one of our Products.

**functional services for everyone:**

We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial

intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that

people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or

geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who

have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos

shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network

and communication technology to help more people connect to the

internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems

to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous

activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

<span style="background-color: red;">that help you understand how Facebook works.

Because Facebook provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service.

To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app,

product or service to the extent of the conflict.

1. </span>**Pr<span style="background-color: red;">i</span><span style="background-color: green;">o</span>v<span style="background-color: red;">a</span><span style="background-color: green;">ide </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">y</span><span style="background-color: green;">onsistent and seamless experiences across the</span>**

<span style="background-color: red;">Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect

and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions. 

 

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy

and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in

connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and

they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in

backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have

shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer

that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data

Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that

information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation

to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

 

3. **Safety**

We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which includes the following commitments by you:

1. You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.

2. You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers)

without our prior permission.

3. You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.

4. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.

5. You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

6. You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.

7. You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.

8. You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-

based restrictions.

9. You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.

10. You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack or interference

with page rendering or other Facebook functionality.

11. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.

 

4. **Registration and Account Security**

Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and

maintaining the security of your account:

1. You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.

2. You will not create more than one personal account.

3. If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.

4. You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial gain, and will use a Facebook Page for such purposes.

5. You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.

6. You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.

7. You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.

8. You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the

security of your account.

9. You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.

10. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a

trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

following:

**3. The permissions you give us**

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: You own the

content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook

Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights

you have to your own content. You are free to share your content

with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services,

though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that

content. 

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered

by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in

connection with our Products, you grant us a non-</span>ex<span style="background-color: red;">ample, that you permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your name and/or profile pi</span>c<span style="background-color: red;">t</span><span style="background-color: green;">l</span>u<span style="background-color: red;">re with your

content or information, without any compen</span>s<span style="background-color: red;">at</span>i<span style="background-color: red;">on </span><span style="background-color: green;">ve,

host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display,

translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent

with your privacy and application settings)</span>. <span style="background-color: green;">This means, for

example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us

permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again,

consistent with your settings) such as service providers that

support our service or other Facebook Products you use. 

You can end this license any time by deleting your content or

account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you

delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies

(though it will not be visible to other users). </span>I<span style="background-color: green;">n addition, content

you delete may continue to appear i</span>f you have s<span style="background-color: red;">elected a specific audience for your content or information, we will respect your c</span>h<span style="background-color: green;">ar</span><span style="background-color: red;">oic</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">d</span> <span style="background-color: green;">it</span><span style="background-color: red;">when</span> w<span style="background-color: green;">ith oth</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">r</span><span style="background-color: red;">
