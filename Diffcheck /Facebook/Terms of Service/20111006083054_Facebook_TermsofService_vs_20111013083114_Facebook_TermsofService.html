<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Facebook Principles, and</p>
<p>governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing</p>
<p>Facebook, you agree to this Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important</p>
<p>disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can</p>
<p>use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it</p>
<p>to help make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it</p>
<p>is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP</li>
</ol>
<p>content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and</p>
<p>application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-</p>
<p>free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with</p>
<p>Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your</p>
<p>account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin</li>
</ol>
<p>on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup</p>
<p>copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the</li>
</ol>
<p>application. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with</p>
<p>that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content</p>
<p>and information. (To learn more about Platform, read our Privacy Policy and Platform</p>
<p>Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are</li>
</ol>
<p>allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information,</p>
<p>and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you</li>
</ol>
<p>understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them</p>
<p>(just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do</p>
<p>that, which includes the following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as</li>
</ol>
<p>spam) on Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using</li>
</ol>
<p>automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our</p>
<p>permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or</li>
</ol>
<p>other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based</p>
<p>restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or</li>
</ol>
<p>offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or</li>
</ol>
<p>discriminatory.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook, such as a denial of service attack.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Registration and Account Security</strong></p>
</li>

<p>that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.</p>

<p>of your account.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to</li>
</ol>
<p>anyone without first getting our written permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if</li>
</ol>
<p>we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username</p>
<p>that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).</p>

<li><strong>Protecting Other People's Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</p>
