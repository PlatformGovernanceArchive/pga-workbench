<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who</p>
<p>interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with</p>
<p>others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make</p>
<p>informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following</li>
</ol>
<p>permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free,</p>
<p>worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete</p>
<p>your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that</li>
</ol>
<p>removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the application. We require applications to</li>
</ol>
<p>respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that application will control how the application can use the content and information</p>
<p>you share. (To learn more about Platform, read our About Platform page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone, including people off of Facebook, will have</li>
</ol>
<p>access to that information and we may not have control over what they do with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any</li>
</ol>
<p>obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise market alcohol-related or other mature content</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes ("promotion") on Facebook without our prior written consent. If we consent, you</li>
</ol>
<p>take full responsibility for the promotion, and will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Registration and Account Security</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us</p>
<p>relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>account.</p>

<li>
<p>You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Protecting Other People's Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</p>

<ol>
