<p>any web content that if shared or posted by a user would be a violation of the user conduct rules set forth above.</p>
<p>Without limiting the forgoing, Online Content Provider agrees not to post a Share Link on any web site that contains,</p>
<p>and represents and warrants that such web site does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing,</p>
<p>harmful, threatening, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent,</p>

<p>Applications")</p>
<p>Platform Developers may use the Facebook Platform and create Platform Applications only in accordance with the</p>
<p>terms and conditions set forth in an agreement entered into between Facebook and the Platform Developer</p>
<p>("Developer Terms"). Our standard Developer Terms consist of the Facebook Developer Terms of Service and the</p>
<p>related Facebook Platform <span style="background-color: red;">Application </span>Guidelines. We may from time to time enter into separate agreements with<span style="background-color: red;"></p>

<p>separate</span> <span style="background-color: green;">separate</p>

<p></span>THE<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;"></p>
<p></span>FACEBOOK PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>Users who install Platform Applications must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the Platform Application</p>
<p>Terms of Use ("Application User Terms") and in these Terms of Use. The Application User Terms are subject to</p>
<p>change without prior notice at any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these terms each</p>
<p>time you install an application and from time to time. Platform Developers may require you to agree to their own</p>
<p>terms of service, privacy policies and/or other policies as a condition of using Platform Applications. Platform</p>
<p>Applications have not been approved, endorsed, or reviewed in any manner by Facebook, and we are not</p>
<p>responsible for your use of or inability to use any Platform Applications, including the content, accuracy, or reliability</p>
<p>of such Application and the privacy practices or other policies of Developers. YOU USE SUCH PLATFORM</p>
<p>APPLICATIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>If you, your friends or members of your network use any Platform Applications, such Platform Applications may</p>
<p>access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings as further</p>
<p>described in our Privacy Policy. Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and use</p>
<p>of such information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse</p>
<p>of such information by such Platform Developers, we do not screen or approve Developers, and we cannot and do</p>
<p>not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such restrictions and agreements. Certain actions you take</p>
<p>through the Platform Applications may be displayed to your friends in your profile, mini-feed and news feed, and you</p>
<p>may opt-out of displaying your Platform Application actions on the Privacy Settings page. Please report any</p>
<p>suspected misuse of information through the Facebook Platform as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may set your preferences for your news feed and mini-feed here.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Connect ("Connect") enables participating third party websites to work just like Facebook Platform</p>
<p>applications. Once you allow a third party website to connect with Facebook, you will be able to use your Facebook</p>
<p>login information to log into that website. The third party website will be able to: generate and publish news feed</p>
<p>and other stories about actions you take on their website; access Facebook information related to you (including</p>
<p>your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the third party</p>
<p>site; and allow you to interact with your friends on the website. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to</p>
<p>allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting participating third party websites, and allow</p>
<p>Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on those third party websites. In addition, once</p>
<p>you allow a participating third party website to connect with Facebook, you agree to allow Facebook and such third</p>
<p>party website to generate and publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on the website without</p>
<p>any additional permission. In the event you no longer want the third party website to publish stories about you, you</p>
<p>can always disable this feature by changing your application settings.</p>
<p>When your friends connect their Facebook account with a participating third party website, Facebook Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find Facebook friends that may also be users of that third party website, and invite them to use</p>
<p>Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you, you may change your privacy settings to</p>
<p>disable this feature.</p>
<p>Connect also gives you the ability to permit Facebook and participating third party websites to generate and publish</p>
<p>news feed and other stories about actions you have taken on such websites, even if you have not gone through the</p>
<p>Connect process. In such cases, you will be asked whether you want to publish the story on Facebook, and will be</p>
<p>given the opportunity to save your answer for future stories. In the event you want to change your settings for</p>
<p>that website, visit your application settings.</p>
<p>Like Platform Applications, third party websites that participate in Connect are required, among other things, to</p>
<p>protect your privacy consistent with your Facebook privacy settings and Facebook's privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Pages</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Pages are special profiles used solely for commercial, political, or charitable purposes. You may not set up</p>
<p>a Facebook Page on behalf of another individual or entity unless you are authorized to do so. This includes fan</p>
<p>Facebook Pages, as well as Facebook Pages to support or criticize another individual or entity.</p>

<p>set forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the</p>
<p>state and federal courts of California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE PROVIDED IN REGARD TO SPECIFIC SERVICES</p>
<p>ON THE SITE IN ANY SPECIFIC TERMS APPLICABLE TO THOSE SERVICES, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM AND</p>
<p>REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OR ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS</p>
<p>OF USE, THE SITE AND/OR THE SERVICE (INCLUDING YOUR VISIT TO OR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR THE SERVICE)</p>
<p>SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, except that: (a) to the extent that either of us has in any manner</p>

<p>trade secret rights, or you have otherwise violated any of the user conduct rules set forth above or in the Code of</p>

<p>appropriate relief may be sought; and (b) no disputes or claims relating to any transactions you enter into with a</p>
<p>third party through the Facebook Marketplace may be arbitrated.</p>
<p>Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its</p>
<p>Commercial Arbitration Rules and, in the case of consumer disputes, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for</p>
<p>Consumer Related Disputes ( the "AAA Consumer Rules") (collectively the "AAA Rules"). The location of the</p>
<p>arbitration and the allocation of costs and fees for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with such AAA</p>
<p>Rules and shall be subject to the limitations provided for in the AAA Consumer Rules (for consumer disputes). If such</p>
<p>costs are determined to be excessive in a consumer dispute, the Company will be responsible for paying all</p>
<p>arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed reasonable. The arbitrator's award shall be</p>
<p>binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL</p>
