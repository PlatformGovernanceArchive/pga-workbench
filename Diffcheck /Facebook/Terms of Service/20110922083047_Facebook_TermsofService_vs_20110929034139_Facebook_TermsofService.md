**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Facebook, you agree to this Statement.

1. **Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>content and information. We encourage you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.

 

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>settings: you grant us a non-exclusive,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>connection with Facebook (IP License).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>reasonable period of time<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

3. When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application. We require<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>can use, store, and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, read our Privacy<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>associate it with you (i.e., your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">
