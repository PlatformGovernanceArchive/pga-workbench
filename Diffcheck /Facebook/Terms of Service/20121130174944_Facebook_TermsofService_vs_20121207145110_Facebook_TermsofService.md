</span>note that Section 17 contains<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.

Date of Last Revision: June 8, 2012.

**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our<span style="background-color: red;"> relationship with users and others who</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">relationship with users and others who </span>interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>this document that help you understand how Facebook works.

<span style="background-color: red;">1. </span>**Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we<span style="background-color: red;"> collect and can use your</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">collect and can use your </span>content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

 

<span style="background-color: red;">2. </span>**Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>privacy and application<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>have shared with you. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>and transfer that content and information. (To learn<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>that information, and to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>for them (just as you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>have no obligation to offer them).

 

<span style="background-color: red;">3. </span>**Safety**

1. You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.

9. You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on Facebook.

10. You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.

<span style="background-color: green;">the security of your </span>account.

9. You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.

10. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>a trademark owner<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

 

<span style="background-color: red;">5. </span>**Protecting Other People's Rights**

We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.

6. You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Book and Wall), or any confusingly similar marks,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>except as expressly<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>information you collect and how you will use it.
