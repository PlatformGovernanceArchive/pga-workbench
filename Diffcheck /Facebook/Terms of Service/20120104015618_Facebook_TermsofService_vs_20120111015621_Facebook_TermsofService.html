<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship</p>
<p>with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can</p>
<p>use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to</p>
<p>read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your</p>
<p>privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically</li>
</ol>
<p>give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive,</p>
<p>transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in</p>
<p>connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account</p>
<p>unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time</p>
<p>(but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application. We require</li>
</ol>
<p>applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application</p>
<p>can use, store, and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, read our Privacy</p>
<p>Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone,</li>
</ol>
<p>including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your</p>
<p>name and profile picture).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may</li>
</ol>
<p>use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the</p>
<p>following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>graphic or gratuitous violence.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or other mature content</li>
</ol>
<p>(including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway,</li>
</ol>
<p>or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on Facebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Facebook, such as a</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>denial of service attack.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</p>
</li>

<p>commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:</p>

</ol>
<p>getting our written permission.</p>
<ol>

<p>name).</p>
