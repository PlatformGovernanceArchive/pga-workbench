<p>By visiting or using the Web site and/or the Service, you agree that the laws of the State of California, without</p>
<p>regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might</p>

<p>Any dispute relating in any way to the Web site and/or the Service (including your visit to or use of the Web site</p>
<p>and/or the Service) shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in San Francisco, California, except that, to the</p>
<p>extent you have in any manner violated or threaten to violate Facebook, Inc. or any of its affiliates' proprietary</p>
<p>or intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court of</p>
<p>competent jurisdiction. For the purpose of such relief, you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of</p>
<p>personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, non-exclusive venue and jurisdiction in the</p>
<p>state and federal courts of California. </p>
<p>Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration</p>
<p>Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of</p>
<p>competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms of</p>
