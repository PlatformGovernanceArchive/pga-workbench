<p>Date of Last Revision: May 1, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our</p>
<p>relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this</p>
<p>Statement.</p>
<p><strong>1. Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures to you about how</p>
<p>we collect and use the information you post on Facebook. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use</p>
<p>the information it contains to help make informed decisions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></p>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how we share your content</p>
<p>through your privacy and application settings. In order for us to use certain types of content and provide you with</p>
<p>Facebook, you agree to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you</li>
</ol>
<p>specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a</p>
<p>non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you</p>
<p>post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or</p>
<p>your account (except to the extent your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it).</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time</p>
<p>(but will not be available to others).</p>
<ol>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we</li>
</ol>
<p>may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer</p>
<p>them).</p>
<p><strong>3. Safety</strong></p>
<p>We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help in order to do that, which</p>
<p>includes the following commitments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications to users (such as spam).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not collect users' information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>gratuitous violence.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise market alcohol-</li>
</ol>
<p>related or other mature content without appropriate age-based restrictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Registration and Account Security</strong></p>
<p>Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some</p>
<p>commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than</li>
</ol>
<p>yourself without permission.</p>

<p>You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not share your password, let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>jeopardize the security of your account.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.</li>
