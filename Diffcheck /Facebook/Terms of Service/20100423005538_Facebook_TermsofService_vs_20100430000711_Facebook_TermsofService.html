<p><strong>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong></li>

<p>others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make</p>
<p>informed decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following</li>
</ol>
<p>permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free,</p>
<p>worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete</p>
<p>your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that</li>
</ol>
<p>removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>

<p><span style="background-color: red;">you sh</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">nd you</span>r<span style="background-color: green;"> agr</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">ement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information</span>.
