<p>content that if shared or posted by a user would be a violation of the user conduct rules set forth above. Without limiting the</p>
<p>forgoing, Online Content Provider agrees not to post a Share Link on any web site that contains, and represents and</p>
<p>warrants that such web site does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing, harmful, threatening, unlawful,</p>
<p>defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent, or invasive of privacy or publicity rights or</p>
<p>that may expose Company or its users to any harm or liability of any type. Upon including of a Share Link, Online Content</p>

<p>officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages,</p>
<p>costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with such Share Link, any links,</p>
<p>content or other items or materials which may be shared or posted through such Share Link, or any breach or alleged breach</p>
<p>of the foregoing representations and warranties.</p>

<p>sublicense) to use the Share Service in order to link to, use, copy, publish, stream, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat,</p>
<p>translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), summarize, and distribute the content, links and other materials of any kind residing</p>
<p>on any web pages on which Online Content Provider places the Share Link.</p>

<p>commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts of California, and you</p>
<p>hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue</p>

<p>for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with such AAA Rules and shall be subject to the limitations provided for</p>
<p>in the AAA Consumer Rules (for consumer disputes). If such costs are determined to be excessive in a consumer dispute, the</p>
<p>Company will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed</p>
<p>reasonable. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
