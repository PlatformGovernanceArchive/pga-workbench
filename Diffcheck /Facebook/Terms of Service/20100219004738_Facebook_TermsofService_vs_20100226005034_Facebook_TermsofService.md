**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our<span style="background-color: red;">

relationship</span> <span style="background-color: red;">with use</span>r<span style="background-color: red;">s and oth</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">lati</span><span style="background-color: red;">rs wh</span>o<span style="background-color: green;">nship</span> <span style="background-color: green;">with users and others who

</span>interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Statement.

1. **Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>how you can use Facebook to share with<span style="background-color: red;"> others and how we collect and can use your content and</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">others and how we collect and can use your content and </span>information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>informed decisions.

2. **Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>through your privacy and application settings.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"),<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>you specifically give us the following<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>permission, subject to your privacy and application settings:<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free,<span style="background-color: red;"> worldwide license to use</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">worldwide license to use </span>any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends<span style="background-color: red;">

when</span> <span style="background-color: green;">wh</span><span style="background-color: red;">you d</span>e<span style="background-color: green;">n</span><span style="background-color: red;">lete</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you delete

</span>your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>computer. However, you understand that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>removed content may persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>application. We require applications to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that<span style="background-color: red;">

application</span> <span style="background-color: red;">will control how the </span>application <span style="background-color: green;">w</span><span style="background-color: red;">can use the content and </span>i<span style="background-color: green;">ll</span><span style="background-color: red;">nformation</span> <span style="background-color: green;">control how the application can use the content and information

</span>you share. (To learn<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>more about Platform, read our About Platform page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>including people off of Facebook, will have<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>access to that information and we may not have control<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>over what they do with it.

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand<span style="background-color: red;">
