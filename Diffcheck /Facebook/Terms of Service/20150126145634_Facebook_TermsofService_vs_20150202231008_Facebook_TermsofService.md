<span style="background-color: green;">Because Facebook provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those

supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.

1. </span>**Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data <span style="background-color: red;">Use </span>Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we<span style="background-color: red;">

collect</span> <span style="background-color: red;">and </span>c<span style="background-color: red;">an use y</span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ur</span><span style="background-color: green;">llect</span> <span style="background-color: green;">and can use your

</span> 

<span style="background-color: green;"> 

2. </span>**Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>privacy and application<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>persist in backup copies for a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>have shared with you. We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and transfer that content and information. (To learn<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>applications, read our Data <span style="background-color: red;">Use </span>Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use<span style="background-color: red;">

that</span> <span style="background-color: red;">informa</span>t<span style="background-color: green;">h</span><span style="background-color: red;">ion, </span>a<span style="background-color: red;">nd </span>t<span style="background-color: red;">o</span> <span style="background-color: green;">information, and to

</span>associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use <span style="background-color: red;">th</span><span style="background-color: green;">your f</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">m</span><span style="background-color: green;">edback or suggestions</span> without any obligation to compensate you

for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
