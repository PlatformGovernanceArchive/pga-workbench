</span>Please<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>note that Section 17 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.

Date of Last Revision: December 11, 2012.

**Statement of Rights and Responsibilities**

This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our

relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in<span style="background-color: red;"> accordance</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">accordance </span>with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.

<span style="background-color: green;">1. </span>**Privacy**

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how<span style="background-color: red;"> we</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">we </span>collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

 

<span style="background-color: green;">2. </span>**Sharing Your Content and Information**

You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to<span style="background-color: red;"> your</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">your </span>privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content<span style="background-color: red;"> that you post</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">that you post </span>on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content<span style="background-color: red;"> has been shared with</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">has been shared with </span>others, and they have not deleted it.

2. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content<span style="background-color: red;"> may</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">may </span>persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

3. When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that<span style="background-color: red;"> others</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">others </span>have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>can use, store,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people<span style="background-color: red;"> may share with</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">may share with </span>applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.)

4. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access<span style="background-color: red;"> and use</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and use </span>that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

5. We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to<span style="background-color: red;"> compensate you</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">compensate you </span>for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

 

<span style="background-color: green;">3. </span>**Safety**

We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which includes the following commitments by you:

1. You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.

2. You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>scrapers)<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>without our prior permission.

3. You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.

4. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.

5. You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

appropriate age-based restrictions.

9. You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Facebook.

10. You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.

interference with page rendering or other Facebook functionality.

12. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.

 

<span style="background-color: green;">4. </span>**Registration and Account Security**

Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to<span style="background-color: red;"> registering</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">registering </span>and maintaining the security of your account:

1. You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.

2. You will not create more than one personal account.

</span>jeopardize<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>the security of your account.

9. You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.

10. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such<span style="background-color: red;"> as when</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">as when </span>a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

 

<span style="background-color: green;">5. </span>**Protecting Other People's Rights**

about</span> <span style="background-color: red;">t</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">bout</span><span style="background-color: red;">gging.
