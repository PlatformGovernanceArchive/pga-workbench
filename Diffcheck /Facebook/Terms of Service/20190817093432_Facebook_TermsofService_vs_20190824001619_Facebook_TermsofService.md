Terms of Service

Welcome to Facebook! 

Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities, and grow

businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other products, features, apps, services,

technologies, and software we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate

terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc. 

We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and

organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you

ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show

you. 

We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your

name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead,

advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may

be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people

are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more. 

Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of

the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the privacy choices you have about

how we use your data.

</span>will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing

content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

2. How our services are funded

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>the Facebook Products covered by these Terms,<span style="background-color: red;">

you</span> <span style="background-color: red;">agree that we can show </span>you a<span style="background-color: red;">ds</span><span style="background-color: green;">gree</span> that <span style="background-color: green;">we can show you ads that

</span>businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Products. We<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use your personal data, such as information about your activity and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>that we can show you relevant and useful ads<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>without telling advertisers who you are. We<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal,<span style="background-color: red;"> and</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">and </span>the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>people who might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them<span style="background-color: red;"> understand how people are interacting with their</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">understand how people are interacting with their </span>content on and off Facebook. For<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>example, that an ad<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>their audience.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or<span style="background-color: red;"> email address that by itself can be</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">email address that by itself can be </span>used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you. You can learn about how we collect and use<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>your data in our Data Policy. You have<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we<span style="background-color: red;"> use to</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">use to </span>determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>provisions.

**3. The permissions you give us**

**3. The permissions you give us**

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 

1. Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected<span style="background-color: red;">

by</span> <span style="background-color: green;">by

</span>intellectual property laws.

You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on

Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own

content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>wherever you want.

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. This is solely

for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>services as described in Section 1 above.

Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our

Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,

run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and

application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and<span style="background-color: red;"> share</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">share </span>it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>service providers that support our service or other Facebook<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Products you<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>use.This license will end when your content is deleted<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>from our systems.

You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can

download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>account.

When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:

immediate deletion is not possible due to technical<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>within a maximum of<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>90 days from when you delete it);

your content has been used by others in accordance with<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this<span style="background-color: red;"> license will</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">license will </span>continue to apply until that content is deleted);<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>or

where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:

**1. Updating our Terms**

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>make our Products better for you and our community. As a result,<span style="background-color: red;">

we</span> <span style="background-color: green;">we

</span>may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we<span style="background-color: red;">

will</span> <span style="background-color: green;">will

</span>notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any<span style="background-color: red;">

updated</span> <span style="background-color: green;">updated

</span>Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the

Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.

**2. Account suspension or termination**

**2. Account suspension or termination**

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Standards,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may<span style="background-color: red;"> also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">als</span><span style="background-color: red;">infringe </span>o<span style="background-color: red;">ther</span> <span style="background-color: green;">suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other

</span>people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>legal reasons.

Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others<span style="background-color: red;">

to</span> <span style="background-color: green;">to

</span>legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or

Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your

account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will

remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.

**3. Limits on liability**

**3. Limits on liability**

We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are

provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions,

delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>INCLUDING<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do<span style="background-color: red;"> not</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">not </span>control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or<span style="background-color: red;"> any</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">any </span>content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>unlawful, and other objectionable content).

We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by

applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential,<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>special,<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>have been<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook<span style="background-color: green;"> </span><span style="background-color: red;">

</span>Products will not<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

**4. Disputes**

**4. Disputes**

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful

to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"),<span style="background-color: red;">

you</span> <span style="background-color: green;">you

</span>Mateo<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and<span style="background-color: red;">

that</span> th<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">at</span> <span style="background-color: green;">the

</span>laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim,<span style="background-color: green;">

**5. Other**

1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and

Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>any prior agreements.

2. Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be

made available and will become part of our agreement with you.<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or

business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our

measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>you post or share content containing music, you must comply with

our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to<span style="background-color: red;"> the</span>

<span style="background-color: green;">the </span>extent of the conflict.

3. If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to

enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing

and signed by us.

4. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>Terms to anyone else without our consent.

5. You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a

person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or

incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>is memorialized.

6. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable

by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>by operation of law or otherwise.

7. You should know that we may need to change the username for<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone<span style="background-color: red;"> else</span>

<span style="background-color: red;">claims th</span>e<span style="background-color: red;"> username and it appears unre</span>l<span style="background-color: green;">s</span><span style="background-color: red;">at</span>e<span style="background-color: red;">d</span> <span style="background-color: green;">cl</span><span style="background-color: red;">to the n</span>a<span style="background-color: green;">i</span>m<span style="background-color: red;">e</span><span style="background-color: green;">s</span> <span style="background-color: red;">you</span><span style="background-color: green;">the</span> <span style="background-color: green;">username and it appears unrelated to the name you

</span>use in everyday life).

8. We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">

</span>our products and services. But you should know that we may use

them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">
