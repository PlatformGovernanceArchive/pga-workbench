<p>and other stories about actions you take on their website; access Facebook information related to you (including</p>
<p>your profile information, friends, and privacy settings) so you can use your Facebook information on the third party</p>
<p>site; and allow you to interact with your friends on the website. In order to make Connect possible, you agree to</p>
<p>allow Facebook to check your Facebook cookies when you are visiting participating third party websites, and allow</p>
<p>Facebook to receive information concerning the actions you take on those third party websites. In addition, once</p>
<p>you allow a participating third party website to connect with Facebook, you agree to allow Facebook and such third</p>
<p>party website to generate and publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on the website without</p>
<p>any additional permission. In the event you no longer want the third party website to publish stories about you, you</p>
<p>can always disable this feature by changing your application settings.</p>
<p>When your friends connect their Facebook account with a participating third party website, Facebook Connect will</p>
<p>enable them to find Facebook friends that may also be users of that third party website, and invite them to use</p>
<p>Connect as well. If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you, you may change your privacy settings to</p>
<p>disable this feature.</p>
<p>Connect also gives you the ability to permit Facebook and participating third party websites to generate and publish</p>
<p>news feed and other stories about actions you have taken on such websites, even if you have not gone through the</p>
<p>Connect process. In such cases, you will be asked whether you want to publish the story on Facebook, and will be</p>
<p>given the opportunity to save your answer for future stories. In the event you want to change your settings for</p>
<p>that website, visit your application settings.</p>
<p>Like Platform Applications, third party websites that participate in Connect are required, among other things, to</p>
<p>protect your privacy consistent with your Facebook privacy settings and Facebook's privacy policy.</p>
